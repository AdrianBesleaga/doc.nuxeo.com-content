This section presents information about the running environment for a Nuxeo server. Listing all required software, giving a recommended configuration and listing some others, known as operational, this sections aims at helping you to validate or define your production environment. However the list is not exhaustive and needs to be completed with the users' experience.

## Requirements

The Nuxeo Platform can run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows operating systems.

{{! multiexcerpt name='requirements-intro'}}

The only requirement to run the Nuxeo Platform is to have **Java 7 or Java 8** (also called Java 1.7 and Java 1.8) installed. You need a **Java Development Kit (JDK)** to develop on the platform, but a JRE is enough to just run it.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

We currently support Oracle's JDK and OpenJDK. Don't hesitate to contact us if you need us to support a JDK from another vendor.

### Checking Your Java Version {{> anchor 'java-check'}}

{{! multiexcerpt name='check-java-version'}}

&nbsp;**To check that you have the right version of Java:**

1.  Open a terminal:

    *   on Linux or Mac OS X: open a terminal.
    *   on Windows: press "windows" key + r, type `cmd` (or `command`) in the Run window and press "OK" or open the "Prompt command" from "Start > Programs > Accessories" menu.
2.  Type `java -version` and press **Enter**.
    If Java is correctly installed on your computer, the name and version of your Java virtual machine is displayed:

    {{#> panel type='code' heading='java -version result on Mac OS'}}

    ```
    java version "1.7.0_17"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_17-b02)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)

    ```

    {{/panel}}{{#> panel type='code' heading='java -version result on Ubuntu'}}

    ```
    java version "1.7.0_15"
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea7 2.3.7) (7u15-2.3.7-0ubuntu1~12.10.1)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 23.7-b01, mixed mode)
    ```

    {{/panel}}

    If Java is not installed on you computer, it fails to display the Java version. Then, you need to install Java (see below).

    If Java is installed but not included in the PATH, it fails to find the Java command. Then, you need to add `$JAVA_HOME/bin/` in your PATH (see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Installing Java

#### For Windows Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-windows'}}

**&nbsp;If the required version of Java is not installed on your computer:**

1.  Download it from the Oracle website ([Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) - [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)) and choose the appropriate platform for your hardware and Windows version.
2.  Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the instructions displayed.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

#### For Linux Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-linux'}}

For Ubuntu, the openjdk-7-jdk package is available from version 12.04 LTS on. For Debian, it is available from "wheezy" (7.0.x).

You can still download Java from the Oracle website ([Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) - [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

#### For Mac OS X Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-macos'}}

Java packages and instructions for installation are available from the Oracle website:

*   Java 7: [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) - [Instructions](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml)
*   Java 8: [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - [Instructions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html)

## Recommendations

### Hardware Configuration

{{! multiexcerpt name='hardware-configuration'}}

The Nuxeo Platform is designed to be scalable and can thus to be deployed on many servers. It can be installed on only one server for a start, and can also easily be installed on many servers. The constant is that there is the need to have one modern server with good performances. Then the other servers can be more lower-end.

The numbers below are given for the one needed high-end server.

*   RAM: 2&nbsp;GB is the minimum requirement for using Nuxeo,
*   CPU: Intel Core 2 or equivalent and better.
    You might want to avoid machines from the Intel Pentium 4 Xeon series since some models have a too small amount of cache. This impairs performance greatly compared to other CPU architecture of the same generation. (Intel Pentium 4 servers are quite widespread because of an attractive price policy.)
*   Storage (disk) space: the minimum Nuxeo installation, along with the needed server and libs, takes something between 200&nbsp;MB and 280&nbsp;MB on a filesystem. Then, the final size will of course depend on the amount of data that will be stored in Nuxeo. A safe bet (until we provide better numbers) is to consider data space ratio of 1.5 to 2.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Default Configuration

The default persistence configuration is lightweight and easy to use, but it is not made for performance.

The Nuxeo Platform uses:

{{! multiexcerpt name='default-configuration'}}

*   H2 for SQL Data (directories, relations ...),
*   Filesystem persistence with&nbsp;[VCS]({{page space='glos' page='vcs'}}) for the Document repository.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### For Optimal Performances

{{! multiexcerpt name='optimal-configuration'}}

*   Linux 64&nbsp;bits,
*   PostgreSQL 9.3, Use PostgreSQL for document repository and all other services.
*   Have plenty of RAM (>= 4&nbsp;GB).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Known Working Configurations

{{! multiexcerpt name='known-working-configurations'}}

#### Browser Support

Nuxeo applications can be used with the browsers below.

{{! multiexcerpt name='supported-browsers'}}

*   IE 10 and greater
*   Firefox 31 ESR and greater
*   Google Chrome 37 and greater
*   Safari 6.2 and greater

{{! /multiexcerpt}} {{#> callout type='note' }}

Browser extensions for Drag & Drop and Live Edit are available for Internet Explorer and Firefox only.

{{/callout}}

#### OS

*   Linux
    *   <span class="im">Debian 7.0 Wheezy</span>
    *   <span class="im">Ubuntu Precise Pangolin 12.04, Trusty Tahr 14.04 and the latest Ubuntu Fast Track</span>
    *   Red Hat Linux RHEL 7
    *   CentOS 7
*   Mac OS

    *   Mac OS X Lion (10.7)
    *   Mac OS X Mountain Lion (10.8)
    *   Mac OS Mavericks (10.9)
    *   Mac OS Yosemite (10.10)
*   Microsoft Windows

    *   For development: Windows 7, Windows 8
    *   For deployment: Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012

<div>**Note about Linux distributions**</div>

<div>Debian and Ubuntu are the reference Linux distributions we run the tests against and we build the packages for. However any recent Linux distribution should be usable as long as:</div>

<div>

*   A JDK 7 or 8 is available
*   You can adapt the provided Linux scripts
*   You can install the third party dependencies (see [Installing and Setting up Related Software]({{page page='installing-and-setting-up-related-software'}})).

</div>

#### JVM

Oracle JDK 7 and 8, 64 bits recommended especially on Windows environment.

#### Storage Backends

Different backends may be set as well for Nuxeo Core repository as for all other Nuxeo services that persist data. Please see the [list of supported databases]({{page page='supported-databases'}}) for each version of Nuxeo.

#### LDAP

{{! multiexcerpt name='supported-directories'}}

*   OpenLDAP
*   OpenDS
*   Microsoft Active Directory
