## How to Install a Nuxeo Virtual Machine Image

{{!-- unmigrated-inline-wiki-markup: {multi-excerpt-include:Installing the Nuxeo Platform on Windows|name=install-vm|nopanel=true} --}}

## How to Install the Nuxeo Platform from the APT Repository for Debian and Ubuntu

Installing the Nuxeo Platform using the APT sources for Debian and Ubuntu installs and configures the platform, but it also installs all required dependencies for an optimal use of the platform.

You can either install the Nuxeo Platform using the OS graphical user interface or from the terminal.

You will need to know two things first:

*   the codename of your distribution (eg **precise** for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
*   which kind of Nuxeo release you want to install (LTS or Fast Track, see [this page]({{page space='main' page='nuxeo-release-cycle'}}) for more details about the Nuxeo release cycle).

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

For the examples below, let's say you are using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ("precise") and want to use the Nuxeo latest LTS release ("releases" repository, for Fast Track releases replace with "fasttracks").

{{/callout}}

&nbsp;

{{!-- unmigrated-inline-wiki-markup: {multi-excerpt:name=apt-repo-install-UI} {note} This requires X11. {note} # Edit the "Software sources" (run "\{{gksudo software-properties-gtk}}",use the Unity Dash or browse "\{{System/Administration/Software Sources}}" Gnome 2 menu). # [Download the Nuxeo key|http://apt.nuxeo.org/nuxeo.key] and import it in the "Authentication" tab. # Add the Nuxeo APT repository: on the "Other Software" tab, add "\{{deb}} \{{[http://apt.nuxeo.org/]}} \{{precise releases}}" to the sources. (if you're using another version of Ubuntu, replace precise by the adequate name, for instance *raring* for Ubuntu 13.04) # Click on:{html}[apt://nuxeo](apt://nuxeo){html}. # Follow the instructions displayed. If it's your first install, you can configure: #* the bind address, #* the port, #* the database (a preconfigured PostgreSQL database is suggested by default). The platform is installed as a service. It is automatically started and set to automatically start at boot. # Open a browser and type the URL [http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/]. The [startup wizard|Setup#Setup-wizard] is displayed so you can setup your Nuxeo platform and select the module you want to install.{multi-excerpt} --}}

### Installing from the APT Sources from the Terminal

{{! multiexcerpt name='apt-repo-install-terminal'}}

1.  Import the Nuxeo key.

    ```bash
    wget -q -O- http://apt.nuxeo.org/nuxeo.key | sudo apt-key add - 
    ```

2.  Add the Nuxeo APT repository.

    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://apt.nuxeo.org/ precise fasttracks"
    ```

    {{#> callout type='tip' }}

    If you don't have `add-apt-repository`, which is a non-standard command, create a file named "`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/nuxeo.list`" and write into it:

    `deb [http://apt.nuxeo.org/](http://apt.nuxeo.org/) precise fasttracks`

    {{/callout}}
3.  Update your APT cache.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

4.  Install the Nuxeo Platform.

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install nuxeo
    ```

5.  Follow the instructions displayed. If it's your first install, you can configure:

    *   the bind address,

    *   the port,

    *   the database (a preconfigured PostgreSQL database is suggested by default).

    The platform is installed as a service. It is automatically started and set to automatically start at boot.

6.  Open a browser and type the URL [http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/](http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/). The [startup wizard]({{page page='setup#setup-wizard'}}) is displayed so you can setup your Nuxeo platform and select the module you want to install.
