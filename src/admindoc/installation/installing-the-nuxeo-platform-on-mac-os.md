On Mac OS, you can install the Nuxeo Platform using two different packages:

*   the .zip archive,
*   the virtual machine image.

## How to Install the Nuxeo Platform From the .zip Archive

Installing the Nuxeo Platform using the .zip package installs the Nuxeo Platform only. External dependencies must be installed separately.

**To install the Nuxeo Platform zip archive:**
Unzip the .zip archive using your favorite tool.

**What's next?**
You want to evaluate the application? You can now [start the server]({{page page='server-start-and-stop'}}).
You want to do a complete installation, compatible for a production environment? You should now [prepare your environment]({{page page='recommended-configurations'}}).

## How to install a Nuxeo Virtual Machine Image
