You can install the Nuxeo Platform on Windows using one of several methods:

*   the Windows installer (.exe),
*   the .zip archive,
*   the virtual machine image.

## Checking Requirements

&nbsp;{{{multiexcerpt 'requirements-intro' page='Hardware and Software Requirements'}}}

Check out the [Hardware and Software Requirements]({{page page='hardware-and-software-requirements'}}) for detailed steps to check your Java version and install it.

## Installing the Nuxeo Platform from the Windows Installer

The Nuxeo Platform is available with a Windows installer that guides you in the install process.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

The Windows installer requires Administrator privileges.

{{/callout}}

To install the application using the Windows installer (.exe), double-click on the .exe installer you downloaded and follow the instructions displayed.

**Installation path**

On Windows in general, and especially on Windows 7, it is highly recommended to install your Nuxeo application at the root of a disk (`C:\Nuxeo` for instance),&nbsp;because of rights issues, limitations on paths length, 32/64 bits conflicts,... An installation in another folder could provoke restart issues at end of the [startup wizard steps]({{page page='setup'}}).

![]({{file name='DM-Windows_installer.png'}} ?w=300)

{{#> callout type='note' }}

*   The Windows installer includes a full JDK installation. You will get an error while installing the **JavaFX** portion. The JavaFX platform is not used by Nuxeo, therefore, when the error appears, click **Close** and continue with the installation.
*   When you launch the Nuxeo services for the first time, you will see an error window that says **pdftohtml.exe** **has stopped working**. To get the pdftohtml utility to work properly, install the **Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012&nbsp;**available on [Microsoft's website](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679).
*   If you are using PostgreSQL, please review the [Configuring PostgreSQL]({{page page='configuring-postgresql'}}) document and use the recommended configurations.

{{/callout}}

**What's next?**
You want to evaluate the application? You can now [start the server]({{page page='server-start-and-stop'}}).
You want to do a complete installation, compatible for a production environment? You should now [prepare your environment]({{page page='recommended-configurations'}}).

## Installing the Nuxeo Platform from the .zip Archive

Installing the Nuxeo Platform using the .zip package installs the Nuxeo Platform only. External dependencies must be installed separately.

**To install the Nuxeo Platform zip archive:**

Unzip the .zip archive using your favorite tool.

**Installation path**

On Windows in general, and especially on Windows 7, it is highly recommended to install your Nuxeo application at the root of a disk (`C:\Nuxeo` for instance),&nbsp;because of rights issues, limitations on paths length, 32/64 bits conflicts,... An installation in another folder could provoke restart issues at end of the [startup wizard steps]({{page page='setup'}}).

**What's next?**
You want to evaluate the application? You can now [start the server]({{page page='server-start-and-stop'}}).
You want to do a complete installation, compatible for a production environment? You should now [prepare your environment]({{page page='recommended-configurations'}}).

## Installing a Nuxeo Virtual Machine Image

{{! multiexcerpt name='install-vm'}}

The Nuxeo Platform is available as ready-to-use 64b virtual machine images from [nuxeo.com](http://www.nuxeo.com). VM images are available for VMWare and Virtual Box. They provide a full environment (OS, database&hellip;) and all required dependencies to make the Nuxeo Platform work.

**To install the Nuxeo virtual machine image and start Nuxeo:**

1.  Unzip the downloaded package.
    You get a folder with the required file for the virtual machine image to run.
2.  Start the virtual machine image in your virtual machine application by double-clicking on it.

    *   For the VMWare package, double-click on the file "nuxeo.vmx".
    *   For the OVF package: in VirtualBox, go to the File menu and choose Import Appliance. Then start the imported virtual machine.The VM image starts.
    ![]({{file name='DM-VM-starting.png'}} ?w=350)
    Then, the Nuxeo application automatically starts.
    ![]({{file name='DM-VM-server-starting.png'}} ?w=350)
    When the Nuxeo application is started, it displays the address at which it is available.
    ![]({{file name='DM-VM-server-started.png'}} ?w=350)
3.  In your browser, type the indicated address.
    The [startup wizard]({{page page='setup#wizard'}}) is displayed to help you configure your application.

    {{#> callout type='info' heading='Shell root access'}}

    The password for the root and nuxeo users are generated the first time you start the virtual machine and are displayed on the console.&nbsp;

    {{/callout}}

**Limitations:**

*   As a 64 bit virtual image, it cannot be installed on a 32 bit system.
*   MP4 video conversion is not supported because of distribution rights limitations.
