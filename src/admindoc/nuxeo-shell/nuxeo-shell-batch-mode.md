As said in the [Overview section]({{page page='nuxeo-shell'}}) there are three modes to execute batch commands:

1.  Run commands from a file
2.  Run commands from standard input.
3.  Run commands specified on the command line - this is a convenient way to run a short list of commands.

## Running Commands From a File

To run commands from a file you should use the **-f** parameter to specify a file containing commands when launching Nuxeo Shell.

Example:

```
java -cp nuxeo-shell.jar org.nuxeo.shell.Main -f my_batch_file

```

Where **my_batch_file** is a file containing the commands to execute - each command on one line. Empty lines and lines begining with **#** are ignored. The **#** character can be use to add comments to a batch file.

Here is an example of a batch file:

```
# connect to local server using the Administrator account.
connect -u Administrator -p Administrator http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation

# we are now in the repository root. Go to /default-domain/workspaces
cd /default-domain/workspaces

# list the content of the workspaces root - as document UIDs
ls -uid

```

If you want to span a command on multiple lines (you may want this for improved readability in case of long commands) you can end the line with a *** character (*make sure** you don't have a space after **). In that case the command will continue on the next line, and so on until no more line ending ** is found or the end of file is reached.

Example:

```
# connect to local server using the Administrator account.
connect -u Administrator -p Administrator http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation

# get all workspaces in the repository
query "SELECT * FROM Document WHERE ecm:primaryType='Workspace' \
      ORDER BY dc:title DESC"

```

## Running Commands From Standard Input

If you want to run batch commands from the terminal standard input you can use the **-** option when launching the Nuxeo shell.
The format of the commands is the same as the one described when running commands from a file.

Here is an example which will run the commands from my_batch_file file by using the Unix **cat** application and pipes:

```
cat my_batch_file | java -cp nuxeo-shell.jar org.nuxeo.shell.Main -

```

## Running Batch Commands from the Command Line

If you just run a few short commands you can specify them directly in the command line of the Nuxeo Shell.

Example:

```
java -cp nuxeo-shell.jar org.nuxeo.shell.Main -e "connect -u Administrator -p Administrator http://localhost:8080/nuxeo/site/automation; ls"

```

Note that commands are separated using a semicolon character.

{{#> callout type='note' heading='Limitations'}}

You cannot run that way commands that contains illegal characters and needs to be escaped.

{{/callout}}
