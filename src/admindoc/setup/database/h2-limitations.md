H2 is first and foremost designed to be an embedded database. We use it in Nuxeo to provide an easy-to-use downloadable demo platform, but it should **never** be used in production.

H2 limitations:

*   It has very bad concurrent behavior (writing a row locks the whole table, therefore deadlocks are much more frequent).
*   Its full-text embedding (using Apache Lucene) is not really transactional.
*   It has a poor query optimizer.
