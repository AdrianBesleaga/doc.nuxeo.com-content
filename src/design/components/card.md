## General Guidance

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. These used to apply a container around a related grouping of information.

They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

### Principles

- **Contained:** A card is identifiable as a single, contained unit.
- **Independent:** A card can stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.
- **Individual:** A card cannot merge with another card, or divide into multiple cards.

## Anatomy

The card container is the only required element in a card.
A card is made up of 2 sections, a header, and a body. The header has limitations but the body section layouts can vary to support the types of content they contain.

1.  **Container**
    Card containers hold all card elements, and their size is determined by the space those elements occupy. Card elevation is expressed by the container.
2.  **Header \[optional\]**
    The header can include an icon, a title, and a collapsible action. The icon and title are located on the left, while the collapsible action is located on the right side of the card header.
3.  **Body \[optional\]**
    The body section can include text elements, data tables, media, etc.

## Behavior

### Focus

When traversing through focus points on a card, visit each focused element before moving to the next card.

### Scrolling

On desktop, card content can expand to reveal more content and scroll within a card.
On mobile, cards can expand and scroll within the screen. Content within cards doesnâ€™t scroll.

## Actions

Actions can be represented by [small secondary or text buttons](page1097924848.html#Bookmark94 'Buttons'), icons, and UI controls. Primary buttons should be reserved for the most important action a user can take on the page. For more than two supplemental actions, use an overflow menu.

The primary action area of a card is typically at the top right, aligned with the header in case there is one.

![]({{file name='img_176.png'}})

Supplemental actions are typically placed at the bottom of the card.

![]({{file name='img_177.png'}})![]({{file name='img_178.png'}})
