Use when there is a list of options and the user may select any number of choices, including zero, one, or several. In other words, each checkbox is independent of all other checkboxes in the list, so checking one box doesnâ€™t uncheck the others. A stand-alone checkbox or a toggle can be used for a single option that the user can turn on or off. If a list consists of multiple options, use checkboxes instead of switches. Checkboxes imply the items are related, and take up less visual space.
