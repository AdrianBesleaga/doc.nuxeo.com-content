{{! multiexcerpt name='glossary-acl'}}ACL stands for Access Control List. An ACL is a set of security rules defined on a document. It says for instance: For the Document D,&nbsp; the group G has the permission to Edit and the User U has the permission to read. In the Nuxeo Platform ACLs are inherited throughout the hierarchy of the repository. A rule defined at the top is then applied all the way down to the deepest documents of your repository.{{! /multiexcerpt}}
