{{! multiexcerpt name='glossary-content-view'}}

A content view is a list of data that comes from the repository. Most of the time, it is a list of documents, but it can also be a list of vocabularies or a list of audit entries. A content view is composed of

*   a query,
*   an optional filter,
*   a result layout that defines which columns of value are displayed,
*   many options that determine whether the list is selectable, exportable, paginated and more.

We could say it is a list of data and the way to display it.

Nuxeo Studio allows to configure content views.
