## Property

{{! multiexcerpt name='glossary-property'}}

Also sometimes referred to as metadata, properties are the granular elements of data stored on a document. There are different types of properties:

*   text properties are strings;
*   dates are stored as such;
*   yes/no properties are booleans;
*   numbered properties use integers;
*   blobs are used to store binary content such as files.

Properties can also be a list of these types, such as a list of dates, a list of strings. They can even have a more complex structure (like a list of &ldquo;contact&rdquo;) and are then named &ldquo;complex properties&rdquo;.
