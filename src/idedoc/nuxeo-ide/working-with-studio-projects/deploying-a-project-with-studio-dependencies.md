{{! excerpt}}

For now, when deploying your projects on the server (using the a deployment profile) the Studio projects are not automatically deployed. In order to deploy both your Nuxeo IDE projects and their Studio project dependencies, your need to:

{{! /excerpt}}

1.  Start your SDK server.
2.  [Deploy the Studio projects using the regular **Admin Center** web interface]({{page space='studio' page='deploying-your-project-in-dev-mode'}}).
3.  Reload the Nuxeo IDE projects on the server by clicking on the **refresh** button in the server view.

    {{#> callout type='tip' }}

    Of course, if you haven't modified your Nuxeo IDE projects, you don't need to reload the Nuxeo IDE project.
