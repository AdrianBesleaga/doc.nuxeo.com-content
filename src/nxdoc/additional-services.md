This section lists additional services and modules that are part of the default distribution of the Nuxeo Platform. You can also refer to the [additional packages section]({{page page='marketplace-add-ons'}}) for understanding how to integrate features offered by additional plugins.

*   [File Manager]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='File Manager'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">The File Manager is used for creating documents from simple binaries.</span>
*   [Nuxeo Core Import / Export API](/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=22380883)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">The import / export service is providing an API to export a set of documents from the repository in an XML format and then re-importing them back. The service can also be used to create in batch document trees from valid import archives or to provide a simple solution of creating and retrieving repository data. This could be used for example to expose repository data through REST or raw HTTP requests.</span>
*   [Conversion]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Conversion'}})
*   [Collections]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Collections'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">This page explains how collections are implemented and how to define the document types that be added or not to a collection.</span>
*   [Preview]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Preview'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">The nuxeo-platform-preview module provides services, converters and adapters to generate HTML previews of a Nuxeo DocumentModel. You may want to understand in details how this module works so as to change the behavior for a given MIME type or add the support of a new format.</span>
*   [Tagging]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Tagging'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">The tag service uses two important concepts: a tag object, and a tagging action. Both are represented as Nuxeo documents.</span>
*   [Thumbnail]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Thumbnail'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Documents can have a thumbnail. A thumbnail is a reduced-size version of a picture used to help in recognizing and organizing documents. It will stand for any kind of document according to the type and/or facet.</span>
*   [Publisher]({{page space='NXDOC60' page='Publisher'}})
