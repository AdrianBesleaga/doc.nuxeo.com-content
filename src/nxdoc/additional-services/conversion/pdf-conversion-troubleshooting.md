For a reason or another, you got one of the following message:

*   `Converter office2html is not available`
*   `Converter any2pdf is not available`

{{! excerpt}}

You probably have the same issue: the `JodConverter` component cannot communicate with the `LibreOffice` process. This page will help you to make the PDF conversion work with a few simple steps.

{{! /excerpt}}

### The PDF Transformation Has Already Worked

1.  Stop your Nuxeo Platform instance. This step is needed because the communication between JodConverter and LibreOffice is initiated at startup, and only at that time.
2.  Kill all remaining LibreOffice processes.
    *   Under Unices, this can be done with the `ps` and `kill` commands:

        ```
        > ps |grep soffice
        17159 pts/0    00:00:03 soffice.bin
        > kill 17159
        > ps |grep soffice
        ```

    *   Under MS Windows, use the Task Manager to identify a `soffice.exe` process and use the **End Task** button to kill it.
3.  Remove the `$NUXEO/tmp` folder: it could contain old files like `tmp/.jodconverter_socket_host-127.0.0.1_port-2003_65`.
4.  Start Nuxeo, log in and try to get your PDF or preview.

### The PDF Transformation Has Never Worked

1.  Follow steps 1 to 3 of the previous paragraph.
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt and start Nuxeo in console mode:

    ```
    > ./nuxeoctl console
    ```

    ```
    C:\> nuxeoctl.bat --gui=false console
    ```

3.  Search in the console the lines about the&nbsp;`org.artofsolving` package.

    It should look like below if everything is fine:

    If something failed, these lines will tell you why and you'll be able to fix your configuration accordingly.
