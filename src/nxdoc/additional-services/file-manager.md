{{! excerpt}}

The File Manager is used for creating documents from simple binaries.

{{! /excerpt}}

From a user perspective, the Nuxeo Platform offers many ways to capture a binary so as to make it a document with a binary property. It can be done from the browser's drag and drop, from WebDAV, from CMIS, from Nuxeo Drive, &nbsp;...

The file manager service is a traditional Nuxeo Platform service that offers some methods that help standardize what happens when a file is captured in the Platform, in regard to:

*   what document type should be created
*   what is the property mapping logic
*   what is the versioning policy
*   how should the binary be processed (exploding a zip, doing some pre-persistence conversions)

## Customising and Using the File Manager Service

*   The File Manager service has a plugin architecture, so that it is possible to contribute different policies depending on the mime-type of the file and the context.&nbsp;The default Nuxeo Platform use cases of the File Manager can be customised reading the documentation of the&nbsp;[file manager service extension point](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewExtensionPoint/org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.filemanager.service.FileManagerService--plugins). There are also means of&nbsp;[controlling the versioning policy](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewExtensionPoint/org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.filemanager.service.FileManagerService--versioning)&nbsp;of documents updated via this channel. Finally, there is a helper for&nbsp;[implementing binary unicity checks](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewExtensionPoint/org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.filemanager.service.FileManagerService--unicity).
*   The File Manager can be called and used in your custom Java code with the standard service call pattern:&nbsp;

```
... fileManager = Framework.getService(FileManager.class);
DocumentModel createdDoc = fileManager.createDocumentFromBlob(coreSession, blob, path, true, fileName);
```

*   And you can also use the&nbsp;[dedicated](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewOperation/FileManager.Import)&nbsp;automation operation, which provides a way to create in one REST call an document from a binary, or to create easily a document from a blob in an automation chain.
