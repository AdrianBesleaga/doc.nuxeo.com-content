The platform already provides multiple clients for accessing the platform remotely.&nbsp;We also provide [a test suite]({{page page='client-api-test-suite-tck'}}) from which you can get inspiration if you want to write a new client for Nuxeo (for example in C#, in C, ...) and want to assert your level of compliance.
