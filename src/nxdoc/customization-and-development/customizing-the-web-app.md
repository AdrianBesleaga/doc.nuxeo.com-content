To enable the customization of how documents, forms and listings are presented, Nuxeo Platform-based application use layouts and content views.</span>

*   [Document List Management]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Document List+Management'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Management of a lost of documents is useful for clipboard and generally document selection features.</span>
*   [Navigation URLs]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Navigation URLs'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">There are two services that help building GET URLs to restore a Nuxeo context.
