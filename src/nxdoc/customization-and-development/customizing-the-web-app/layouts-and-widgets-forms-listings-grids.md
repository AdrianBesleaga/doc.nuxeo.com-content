{{! excerpt}}

Layouts and widgets have been originally designed to display forms, and have been improved to handle listings as well as summary pages. These configuration elements are used to generate page fragments from XML configurations contributed to [Nuxeo Runtime extension points]({{page page='extension-points-configuration'}}).

{{! /excerpt}}

In this chapter we will see how to define layouts and associated widgets, and use them in XHTML pages.

{{#> callout type='info' }}

Layouts and Widgets can be configured using Studio: Check out the [Form Layouts]({{page space='studio' page='form-layouts'}}) documentation.

{{/callout}} {{#> callout type='tip' heading='Online demo'}}

You might want to check out the [Layout Showcase](http://showcase.nuxeo.com/layout) for a demo.

{{/callout}}

## Key Concepts

### Layouts

In a document oriented perspective, layouts are mostly used to display a document metadata in different use cases: present a form to set its schema fields when creating or editing the document, and present these fields values when simply displaying the document. A single layout definition can be used to address these use cases as it will be rendered for a given document and in a given [mode]({{page page='layout-and-widget-modes'}}).

&nbsp;

{{!-- unmigrated-wiki-markup: {multi-excerpt:layout-definition}A layout is a group of widgets that specifies how widgets are assembled and displayed. It manages widget rows and has global control on the rendering of each of its widgets.{multi-excerpt} --}}

&nbsp;

### Widgets

> There's a widget in the closet.
> 
> &ndash; R. Kellise

A widget defines how one or several fields from a schema will be presented on a page. It can be displayed in [several modes]({{page page='layout-and-widget-modes'}}) and holds additional information like for instance the field label. When it takes user entries, it can perform conversion and validation like usual JSF components.

Widgets have been made more generic to handle rendering of elements in listings, for instance, or to render information that is not directly linked to a document metadata, like presenting its relations.

### Widget Types

A widget definition includes the mention of its type. Widget types make the association between a widget definition and the JSF component tree or xhtml template that will be used to render it in a given [mode]({{page page='layout-and-widget-modes'}}).

The following pages explain how to work with layouts and widgets.

*   [Standard Widget Types]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Standard Widget+Types'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">A series of widget types has been defined for the most generic uses cases.</span>
*   [Custom Layout and Widget Templates]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Custom Layout+and+Widget+Templates'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Some templating features have been made available to make it easier to control the layouts and widgets rendering.</span>
*   [Custom Widget Types]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Custom Widget+Types'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Custom widget types can be added to the standard list thanks to another extension point on the web layout service.</span>
*   [Layout and Widget Display]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Layout and+Widget+Display'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Layouts can be displayed thanks to a series a JSF tags that will query the web layout service to get the layout definition and build it for a given mode.</span>
*   [Generic Layout Usage]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Generic Layout+Usage'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">Layouts can be used with other kind of objects than documents.</span>
*   [Customize the Versioning and Comment Widget on Document Edit Form]({{page space='NXDOC58' page='Customize the+Versioning+and+Comment+Widget+on+Document+Edit+Form'}})&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;<span class="smalltext">On documents edit form, a Comment textarea is displayed, and this text is visible in the History tab. When document is versionable, versioning options are also displayed. This page provides some examples to customize this behavior. These examples can be contributed in Nuxeo Studio (Advanced Settngs > XML Extensions) or in Nuxeo IDE.</span>
