If you need to move your synchronisation roots of Nuxeo Drive to another computer, we suggest to just initiate an empty Nuxeo Drive on the new computer.

Another possibility is to use a migration tool of Microsoft available [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc974331).

We do not recommend to copy those files to USB keys to transfer as it will not migrate all the datas correctly.
