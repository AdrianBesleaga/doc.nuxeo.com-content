### Sub Workflow Example

The subworkflow functionality is the ability to call a workflow from another workflow (creating inception-like workflows), and to pass it variables along the way. The main workflow is suspended while the subworkflow runs, and resumes when the subworkflow ends.

### One step validation flow based on lifecycle only

In this tutorial we will implement a chained workflow, that enables to validate a document in one step. We will make sure to store a few important dates on the document and we will log important steps into the document's history. Also, we will make sure that during this workflow, people receive consistent email notifications.
