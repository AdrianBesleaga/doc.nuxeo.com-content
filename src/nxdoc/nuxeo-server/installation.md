The Nuxeo Platform comes in different packages and can be installed on any operating system. You may have to install:

*   a zip archive (works on any operating system),
*   a Windows installer (.exe),
*   a virtual machine image (works on any operating system),
*   a .deb package (works on Linux Debian and Ubuntu).

## General Installation Process

Installing Nuxeo Platform is done in a few steps:

1.  Have a look at our Hardware and Software Requirements in the section below, as well as our [supported databases]({{page page='supported-databases'}}) and [application servers]({{page page='supported-application-servers'}}). You may also want to read our page regarding [required storage space]({{page page='how-to-estimate-volume-usage'}}).
2.  [Install and Set up related required software]({{page page='installing-and-setting-up-related-software'}}) (unless you deploy on Amazon where the image already includes it).
3.  Install and start the Nuxeo Platform server.
    To understand how to start a Nuxeo Platform server on those various environments you can read and follow one of our recipes:
    *   [Installing the Nuxeo Platform on Linux]({{page page='installing-the-nuxeo-platform-on-linux'}})
    *   [Installing the Nuxeo Platform on Windows]({{page page='installing-the-nuxeo-platform-on-windows'}})
    *   [Installing the Nuxeo Platform on Mac OS]({{page page='installing-the-nuxeo-platform-on-mac-os'}})
    *   [Deploying Nuxeo on Amazon AWS]({{page page='deploying-nuxeo-on-amazon-aws'}})
    *   [Deploying Nuxeo on CloudFoundry]({{page page='deploying-nuxeo-on-cloudfoundry'}})
    *   [Deploying as a Standard Static WAR]({{page page='deploying-as-a-standard-static-war'}})
4.  Run the [Configuration Wizard]({{page page='configuration-wizard'}}) (not in the case of a standard static war).

## Hardware and Software Requirements

This section presents information about the running environment for a Nuxeo server. Listing all required software, giving a recommended configuration and listing some others, known as operational, this sections aims at helping you to validate or define your production environment. However the list is not exhaustive and needs to be completed with the users' experience.

### Requirements

The Nuxeo Platform can run on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows operating systems.

{{! multiexcerpt name='requirements-intro'}}

The only requirement is to run Java. Below are the Nuxeo-Java compatibilities:

{{{multiexcerpt 'java_requirement' page='Compatibility Matrix'}}}

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

We currently support Oracle's JDK and OpenJDK. Don't hesitate to contact us if you need us to support a JDK from another vendor.

#### Checking Your Java Version&nbsp;{{> anchor 'java-check'}}

{{! multiexcerpt name='check-java-version'}}

&nbsp;**To check that you have the right version of Java:**

1.  Open a terminal:

    *   On Linux or OS X: open a terminal.
    *   On Windows: press "windows" key + r, type `cmd` (or `command`) in the Run window and press "OK" or open the **Prompt command** from **Start** > **Programs** > **Accessories** menu.
2.  Type `java -version` and press **Enter**.
    If Java is correctly installed on your computer, the name and version of your Java virtual machine is displayed:

    ```
    java version "1.8.0_66"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_66-b17)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.66-b17, mixed mode)

    ```

    If Java is not installed on you computer, it fails to display the Java version. Then, you need to install Java (see below).

    If Java is installed but not included in the PATH, it fails to find the Java command. Then, you need to add `$JAVA_HOME/bin/` in your PATH (see [How do I set or change the PATH system variable?](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

#### Installing Java

##### For Linux Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-linux'}}

For Ubuntu, no Java 8 package is yet available. You can still download&nbsp;[Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) from the Oracle website.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

##### For OS X Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-macos'}}

Java packages and instructions for installation are available from the Oracle website:

*   [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
*   [Instructions](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/mac_jdk.html)

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

##### For Windows Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='java-install-windows'}}

**&nbsp;If the required version of Java is not installed on your computer:**

1.  Download it from the Oracle website ([Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)) and choose the appropriate platform for your hardware and Windows version.
2.  Run the downloaded .exe file and follow the instructions displayed.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Recommendations

#### Hardware Configuration

{{! multiexcerpt name='hardware-configuration'}}

The Nuxeo Platform is designed to be scalable and can thus to be deployed on many servers. It can be installed on only one server for a start, and can also easily be installed on many servers.
The numbers below are given as an idea, sizing obviously depends on your usage of the platform.

*   RAM: 2&nbsp;GB is the minimum requirement for using Nuxeo 4 to 8 is advised, per Nuxeo node.
*   CPU: 4 CPU per Nuxeo node at least.
*   Storage (disk) space: the minimum Nuxeo installation, along with the needed server and libs, takes something between 200&nbsp;MB and 280&nbsp;MB on a filesystem. Then, the final size will of course depend on the amount of data that will be stored in Nuxeo. A safe bet (until we provide better numbers) is to consider data space ratio of 1.5 to 2.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

#### Embedded Database:H2

The distribution comes with a default persistence configuration that is lightweight and easy to use, but it is not made for poduction usage:

{{! multiexcerpt name='default-configuration'}}

*   H2 for SQL Data (directories, relations ...),
*   Filesystem persistence with&nbsp;[VCS]({{page space='glos' page='vcs'}}) for the Document repository.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}
You should adapt that configuration as soon as you want to use your application for real life use cases.

#### For Optimal Performances

{{! multiexcerpt name='optimal-configuration'}}

*   Linux 64&nbsp;bits,
*   PostgreSQL 9.6, Use PostgreSQL for document repository and all other services.
*   Have plenty of RAM (>= 8&nbsp;GB).

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

<div>**Note about Linux distributions**</div>

<div>Debian and Ubuntu are the reference Linux distributions we run the tests against and we build the packages for. However any recent Linux distribution should be usable as long as:</div>

<div>

*   A JDK 8 is available
*   You can adapt the provided Linux scripts
*   You can install the third party dependencies (see&nbsp;[Installing and Setting Up Related Software]({{page page='installing-and-setting-up-related-software'}})).

</div>

#### JVM

Oracle JDK 8, 64 bits recommended especially on Windows environment.

#### Storage Backends

Different backends may be set as well for Nuxeo Core repository as for all other Nuxeo services that persist data. Please see the&nbsp;[list of supported databases]({{page page='supported-databases'}})&nbsp;for each version of Nuxeo.

#### LDAP

*   OpenLDAP
*   OpenDS
*   Microsoft Active Directory
