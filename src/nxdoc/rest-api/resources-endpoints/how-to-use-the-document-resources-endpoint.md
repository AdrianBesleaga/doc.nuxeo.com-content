We provide some sample usages of the REST API. You can also have a try of the REST API on the [Nuxeo Platform API Playground](http://nuxeo.github.io/api-playground/#/).

## Documents

### Updating a Document

To update a document it&rsquo;s very easy. You have to&nbsp;<span class="s1">PUT</span>&nbsp;on the document resource, and pass a reduced version of the entity type content as the data. You can also pass the full set f data, but it is not mandatory.&nbsp;

```
    PUT /nuxeo/site/api/v1/id/{idOfTheDoc}
    {
        "entity-type": "document",
        "repository": "default",
        "uid": "37b1502b-26ff-430f-9f20-4bd0d803191e",
        "properties": {
            "dc:title": "The new title",
            "dc:description": "Updated via a so cool and simple REST API"
            "common:icon": "/icons/file.gif",
            "common:icon-expanded": null,
            "common:size": null
        }
    }
```

### Creating a Document

To create a new document under the current resource, you have to send a&nbsp;<span class="s1">POST</span>&nbsp;request with the following data:

```
POST /nuxeo/site/api/v1/id/{idOfParentDoc}
{
    "entity-type": "document",
    "name":"newDoc",
    "type": "File",
    "properties": {
        "dc:title": "The new document",
        "dc:description": "Created via a so cool and simple REST API"
        "common:icon": "/icons/file.gif",
        "common:icon-expanded": null,
        "common:size": null
    }
}
```

In this case, the id of the document is the parent document's id, and the&nbsp;`name`&nbsp;property in the entity stands for the name of the newly created document.&nbsp;You don&rsquo;t have to specify a UID since the session will create one for you. It will be returned in the response.

### Deleting a Document

Finally, in order to delete a document, you just have to send a&nbsp;<span class="s1">DELETE</span>&nbsp;request to the document resource.&nbsp;

```
DELETE /nuxeo/site/api/v1/id/{idOfTheDoc}
```

## List Adapters

### Children of a Given Document

Given a document resource, it's very simple to get its children:

```
GET /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@children?page=0&pagesize=20&maxResults=100
```

This returns a list of documents with the&nbsp;<span class="s1">documents</span>&nbsp;entity type:

```
{
    "entity-type": "documents",
    "isPaginable": true,
    "totalSize": 3,
    "pageIndex": 0,
    "pageSize": 50,
    "pageCount": 1,
    "entries": [
      {   
        "entity-type": "document",
        "repository": "default",
        "uid": "afb373f1-08ed-4228-bfe8-9f93131f8c84",
        "path": "/default-domain/sections",
        "type": "SectionRoot",
            ...
        "contextParameters": {
            "documentURL": "/nuxeo/site/api/v1/id/afb373f1-08ed-4228-bfe8-9f93131f8c84"
        }            
       },
       ...
    ]
}
```

Query parameters are not mandatory and are by default:

*   `page`: 0
*   `pageSize`: 50
*   `maxResult`: nolimit

{{#> callout type='info' }}

In the response, for each document, you have a `documentURL` property that points to the API endpoint's id.

{{/callout}}

### Searching Documents

It is possible to search for documents in several ways.

```
GET /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@search?fullText=nuxeo&orderBy=dc:title
```

This returns the list of documents under the pointed resource that fulfills the full-text search for the&nbsp;<span class="s1">"nuxeo</span>" term. The same query parameters as in the&nbsp;`<span class="s1">@children</span>`&nbsp;adapter apply, plus the&nbsp;`<span class="s1">orderBy</span>`&nbsp;one. If the pointed resource is not a&nbsp;<span class="s1">Folder</span>, then the search is issued from the parent document.

You can also make some direct NXQL queries with this endpoint, like this:

```
GET /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@search?query=SELECT * FROM File
```

It will return a paged result set.

### Using Page Provider Adapters

If you have defined some page adapters that rely on&nbsp;only one parameter which is the&nbsp;<span class="s1">id</span>&nbsp;of the document, then you can use it with the page adapter endpoint:

```
GET /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@pp/{myPageProvider}
```

Same query parameters apply for pagination as for the&nbsp;`<span class="s1">@children</span>`&nbsp;adapter.

As it would be great to not only bind the id of a document, but also the document itself as a parameter of the page provider (using EL to define parameters). This API is then subject to change during the 5.9.x series.

## Automation Chains

### On a Document

As we have a way to point to documents with resources, we provide a way to run an automation chain on them. You can use any chain that takes a document as input. For instance to call that operation&nbsp;`<span class="s1">myOperation</span>`&nbsp;on a document, just send an&nbsp;<span class="s1">POST</span>&nbsp;request like that:

```
POST /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@op/{myOperation}
{
  params: {
    opParam: "value"  
  }
}
```

The response will depend on the result of the automation chain.

If you want to run a chain, just use the same endpoint and prefix the chain name by&nbsp;`<span class="s1">Chain.</span>`, for instance:

```
POST /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@op/Chain.{myChain}
{
  params: {
    chainParam: "value"  
  }
}
```

### On a List of Documents

We also have a way to point to lists of documents through&nbsp;the use of list adapters. This way, we are&nbsp;also able to run operations or chains on lists of documents. For instance:

```
POST /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheFolder}/@children/@op/Chain.myChain
{
  params: {
	chainParam: "value"  
  }
}
```

This way we run the&nbsp;`<span class="s1">myChain</span>`&nbsp;operation on the children of the given folder.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

Pay attention to the fact that document list adapters are paged. That means that the chain will run on all document of the current page.

{{/callout}}

## Business Object Adapters

Since 5.7.2, you can use&nbsp;[Business objects]({{page page='java-automation-client#managing-business-objects'}})&nbsp;with Automation. They are also bound on the REST API and you just have to use the same semantics than for document resources.

### Getting a Business Object

```
GET /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@bo/BusinessBeanAdapter
```

will return&nbsp;

```
{
    entity-type: "BusinessBeanAdapter"
    id: "37b1502b-26ff-430f-9f20-4bd0d803191e",
    "type": "Domain",
    "title":"Default domain"
    "description:""
}
```

### Updating a Business Object

To update a business object, you just have to send a PUT request one the business object resource with its content data like this:

```
PUT /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@bo/BusinessBeanAdapter
{
	"entity-type: "BusinessBeanAdapter"
	"value": {
		id: "37b1502b-26ff-430f-9f20-4bd0d803191e",
	    "type": "Domain",
	    "title":"Default domain"
	    "description:"My new description"
	 }
}
```

### Creating a Business Object

And then to create a business object, you have to issue a&nbsp;<span class="s1">POST</span>&nbsp;on the object resource plus the name of the newly created document, like this:

```
POST /nuxeo/site/api/v1/path/{pathOfTheDoc}/@bo/BusinessBeanAdapter/{newName}
{
	entity-type: "BusinessBeanAdapter",
	value: {
	  "type": "Note",
	  "title":"A sample note",
	  "description:"",
	  "note":"The content of my note"
	}
}
```
