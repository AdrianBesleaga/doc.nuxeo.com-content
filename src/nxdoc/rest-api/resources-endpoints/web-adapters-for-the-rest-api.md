This API also has the concept of "adapter". An adapter is a URL segment that starts with "@" and that transforms the input resource so as to return another resource. For example, using&nbsp;`@blob`&nbsp;will return the file of a document (the one stored on the property given by the next URL segment), and chaining it to&nbsp;`@op`&nbsp;will call an operation (that takes a blob in input):

```
/nuxeo/api/v1/id/{docId}/@blob/file:content/@op/Blob.ToPDF
```
