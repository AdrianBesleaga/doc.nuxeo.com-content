This page explains how to use the Nuxeo Java API.

{{! /excerpt}}

## Java Services

The Nuxeo Platform contains a built-in notion of service. Services are Java interfaces exposed and implemented by a Component.

From within a Nuxeo Runtime aware context, you can access a service locally (in the same JVM) by simply looking up its interface:

```
RelationManager rm = Framework.getService(RelationManager.class)
```

You can find the list of existing services on the [Nuxeo Platform Explorer](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/listServices). You will also need to understand main Java classes, using the [javadoc](http://community.nuxeo.com/api/nuxeo/).

## Typical Use Cases

You may want to use this API from:

*   A Seam component when customizing the default webapp,
*   An Event Listener that would do some specific things,
*   A custom operation that would use the built-in services,
*   ...
