## Contributions
- why there is different ways to contribute (slots, named layouts, etc)
- reference there is manual and studio way (briefly as they are already explained)
- each sub-section will be a link to a page (TODO: change from ### to link list)
  - on these pages, all slots should have link to the slot on the reference page
