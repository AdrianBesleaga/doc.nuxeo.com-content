## Building a Custom App

- introduction to custom app (intent and feature scope)
- development environment (tools, polymer SK and CLI)
- Nuxeo Generator usage
- development steps (simple app with repo browser and upload)
- build app (vulcanizations, etc..)
- nuxeo-elements-quickstart.md (it can be a good starting point)
