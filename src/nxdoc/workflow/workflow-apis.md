{{! excerpt}}

We list here all the useful available workflow APIs if you want to programmatically change a workflow instance.

{{! /excerpt}}

## Java API

You can read the javadoc of the workflow engine main services:&nbsp;

*   The [DocumentRouting Service](http://community.nuxeo.com/api/nuxeo/5.8/javadoc/org/nuxeo/ecm/platform/routing/api/DocumentRoutingService.html),
*   The [Task Service](http://community.nuxeo.com/api/nuxeo/5.8/javadoc/org/nuxeo/ecm/platform/task/TaskService.html).

Note that most of the time provided Automation operations will do what you want to do and are easier to use.

## Automation

The framework provides a few interesting Automation operation, in the category "Workflow Context".

*   [Start Workflow](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewOperation/Context.StartWorkflow): Starts a workflow with the given&nbsp;`id`&nbsp;and to initialize its workflow variable. The document id of the created workflow instance is available under the&nbsp;`workflowInstanceId`&nbsp;context variable.
    The&nbsp;`id`&nbsp;parameter is the id of the workflow definition, as it was configured in Studio.
*   [Cancel Workflow](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-5.7.3/viewOperation/Context.CancelWorkflow): Cancels a workflow giving its id. The&nbsp;`id`&nbsp;parameter is the id of the document representing the workflow instance.
*   [Resume Workflow](/explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-5.7.3/viewOperation/Workflow.ResumeNodeOperation): Allows to resume a node of the workflow. It probably was suspended waiting for a task to be solved. This operation allows to force the resuming, and will let the task in a "cancelled" state.
*   [Complete task](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-5.7.3/viewOperation/Workflow.CompleteTaskOperation): Allows to close a task as if it was done via the user interface, with the ability to pass some data, as if it came from a form.
*   [Set Workflow Variable](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewOperation/Context.SetWorkflowVar): Allows to set workflow variables, either from within the execution of a workflow automation chain (input, output, transition) or externally, provided the workflow instance id.
*   [Set Node Variable](http://explorer.nuxeo.org/nuxeo/site/distribution/Nuxeo%20Platform-6.0/viewOperation/Context.SetWorkflowNodeVar): Allows to set node variables within the execution of a workflow automation chain (input, output, transition).
