# How to disable Drive notifications in Windows?

## The Problem
Notifications can be very disruptive sometimes. How to forbid these notifications on the Windows client?

## A possible solution

In Windows 10, in **Windows Parameters &gt; System** , there is a tab **Notifications and Actions**

Once a notification occurs, there is the ability in this Windows tool tab to deactivate the notifications from Drive specifically.

In Windows 7, the equivalent may be given in the link https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/help/975785/guided-help-customize-the-notification-area-in-windows-7
