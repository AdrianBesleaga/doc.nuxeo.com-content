# How to perform an import of a hierarchical vocabulary from a csv file
## Problem
The goal is to import a csv file with a hierarchical vocabulary inside. There are more than 100 elements in the file. Since the number of element is higher than 100 elements, you must upload the csv file and make a reference to it. After doing this and updating the project, the vocabulary appears in the admin tab vocabulary but the drop-down list (single directory suggestion) is empty.
## Solution
You must set obsolescence and ordering columns in the Excel spreadsheet so that the widget displays it.
