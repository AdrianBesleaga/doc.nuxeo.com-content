Here is a brief presentation about **SKBO**, acronym standing for **Support Knowledge Base Outlines**.

We attempt here to give you insights of what Support can bring as help when building your solution. Sharing these solutions in a concise yet precise format and instructions will help you design and shape your application during the so-called "development" phase, and find immediate guidelines in troubleshooting your application, would the worse arise at runtime stage.

The different **SKBs**, or extracts from SKBO, form a vast set of ready-to-use tips, tricks and methods about all Nuxeo subsystems. There is no intent to replace the existing sources of Nuxeo knowledge ([documentation](https://doc.nuxeo.com) , [university](https://university.nuxeo.com), or the [Nuxeo blog](https://www.nuxeo.com/blog/#) ...) but you may find here a complementary source of knowledge and applied solutions.

The following different tables of content give a rough and draft overview of the broad range of solutions Support can help you come up to. The intent here, more than seeking through these tables of contents, is that you are able to retrieve the SKBs through your favorite search engine, given the keywords you are in seek of should appear in these SKBs.
