You need to make sure that your Studio project has a correctly configured Target Platform: the target platform is the version of Nuxeo product for which the configuration will be generated. It should match the version of the Nuxeo product you are using.
Updating the target platform of your project will have two main impacts:

*   You will probably have **more features available** than if you are on an older target, as Nuxeo Studio will be able to leverage all the new configurability the new version of the Nuxeo product brought.
*   You will be 100% sure that what is generated by Studio is **compliant with the version of the product you are running**, as Studio is responsible for this.

To change the target platform, for instance to Nuxeo DM 5.4.2, just follow the steps mentionned on the following screenshot.
