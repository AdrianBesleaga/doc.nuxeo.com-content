{{#> callout type='info' }}

Default search configuration is defined the Search menu item in Nuxeo Platform 6.0\. For previous version, it is set in the Advanced Search menu entry.

{{/callout}}{{! excerpt}}

The Nuxeo Platform 6.0 Search menu item enables you to set up a new Default Search form to replace the one available in the Nuxeo Platform Search tab. The Advanced search menu item available for previous versions of the platform enables to define a new Advanced search form.

{{! /excerpt}}

It is basically a content view that is preset to be a search content view. So it shows the same tabs and configuration features as a [content view]({{page page='content-views'}}) with the differences below.

*   Logically the Flags section of the content view definition is not displayed here.
*   Since it is meant to replace the default search, it doesn't show the Enablement tab available for other search content views. (From Nuxeo Platform 6.0)

Please report to the [Content Views]({{page page='content-views'}}) documentation.
