If you have chosen the Web UI as your default interface you will need to become familiar with the View Designer in order to customize your interface to fit your needs.

View Designer application is integrated with Nuxeo Studio. and brings with it all the configuration elements needed to quickly and easily create a custom WebUI interface, using Nuxeo Elements and HTML syntax.

View Designer is for everyone, whether you are a tech-savvy or not. On one hand, View Designer is for non-technical users: it provides an intuitive interface to build a customized application without having any developments skills. If youâ€™re familiar with Nuxeo Studio, then the View Designer will be as easy to master. On the other hand, View Designer is also oriented toward developers because all the layouts are based upon HTML and Nuxeo Elements, so front-end developers are able to create a creative and complex layout.

View Designer relies on document models and business logic. That means that content models, workflow process templates, automation chains and automation scripts, roles and permissions, vocabularies, and extensions should be previously defined in [Nuxeo Studio]({{page version='' space='studio' page='nuxeo-studio'}}), because they are not aimed at being created in the View Designer application.

You can access the View Designer application from the link displayed next to your Nuxeo Studio project name.

We divided the documentation in 3 pages to represent the 3 main sections of the view designer screen:
- The [Left menu]({{page page='left-menu'}})
- The [Main View]({{page page='main-view'}})
- The [Properties Catalog]({{page page='properties-catalog'}})
