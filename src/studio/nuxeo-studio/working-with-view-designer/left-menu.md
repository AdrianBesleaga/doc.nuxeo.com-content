{{#> callout type='info' heading='Availability'}}
This feature is available for target platforms Nuxeo Platform LTS 2016 and above.
{{/callout}}

The left menu displays three different tabs to give you the ability to design and customize your UI as you need:
- [Layouts](#layouts-tab)
- [UI](#ui-tab)
- [Resources](#resources-tab)

## Layouts Tab

- **Local Types**: Lists the document types that you have created.
- **Built-in Types**: Lists the document types available by default on the platform.
- **Workflows**: Lists the workflows that you have created.
- **Page Providers**: Lists the page providers that you have created.

On documents (local types and built-in types for example), 5 layouts are available to let you customize the creation, edition, import, metadata and the view of your documents.

Once customized, layouts are displayed with a bold font and an asterisk. (SCREENSHOT)

## Resources Tab

The Resources tab represents the physical view of the package which is going to be deployed in the Nuxeo repository. Itâ€™s an alternative visualisation of all components created in the Layout and UI tab. Additionally, it gives you the possibility to create folders and upload files, such as pictures or custom scripts: for example, you can use it to display the document icons. You will also be able to create new element on this tab.

**To upload a new file**, select the folder where you want to upload it and then click on the upload button (ICON). A popup window let you select your document in your local files.

**To create a new file**: select the folder where you want to create it and then click on the create button (ICON). A popup window ask you if you want to create an Empty File, an Element or a folder.
If you select an Element, the architecture is already ready to use.
