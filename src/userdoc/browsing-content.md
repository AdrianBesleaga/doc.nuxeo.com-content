To help you find accurate documents, the Nuxeo Platform features several different ways to access documents.

## Dashboard

Every user has a personal dashboard that displays information he finds relevant and help him have a global view of the application's activity.

The dashboard is composed of a set of boxes that display either a list of documents matching a criteria (all the workspaces the user can access, the last documents he modified, the last documents that have been published...), or possibly a piece of information either from the Platform or from external websites.

To access your dashboard, click on the **Home** main tab. Your dashboard is the default tab of your Home.
![]({{file name='CAP-dashboard.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

## Navigation Tree

There are different means to access content in the Nuxeo Platform. One of them is the navigation tree, that enables users to access documents by going through folders (physical navigation).

The default navigation tree displayed on the left hand side of the pages is the folders navigation tree. It displays all the domain structure from the root. It enables you to easily access any space in the application structure.

![]({{file name='navigation_tree.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

The navigation tree displays folderish documents, i.e. documents in which you can create other documents (workspaces, folders, etc.).

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

It is possible to add another type of navigation tree based on metadata instead of folder structure by installing the [Nuxeo Virtual Navigation add-on]({{page space='nxdoc60' page='nuxeo-virtual-navigation'}}).

{{/callout}}

## Tag Cloud

The Document Management module includes [tagging of documents]({{page page='tags'}}), which enables users to apply their own labels on documents. The tag cloud lists all tags on documents, with their size growing as the tag is applied on several documents.

![]({{file name='tag-cloud.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

To see all documents tagged with the same label, click on the tag in the tag cloud.

## {{> anchor 'change-content-view-presentation'}}Changing Content Presentation

Users can change the way content is presented in the folderish repositories (workspaces, folders, sections) and search results.They can also change the displayed information.

### Changing the View Mode

Two views of the content lists are available:

*   list view (default view): this view displays title of the documents with a small icon (that depends on the type of document or main attachment type) and a set of metadata in a table;
    ![]({{file name='list-view.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)
*   thumbnail view: this view displays a thumbnail of documents. For folders, the thumbnail of the first item in the folder is displayed.
    ![]({{file name='thumbnail-view.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

**To change presentation:**
Click on one of the icons displayed on the top right corner of **Content** tab:

*   list view icon: ![]({{file name='DM-list-view-icon.png' page='icons-index'}})
*   icon view icon: ![]({{file name='DM-icon-view-icon.png' page='icons-index'}})

### {{> anchor 'changing-results-columns'}}Changing Displayed Information

Lists of documents, whether in list view or thumbnail view, show some information about the documents, like their title, the last contributor, their life cycle state, etc. Users can change the information displayed, i.e. the columns for the list view or the information below the document thumbnail in thumbnail view.

**Note:** Editing results column is possible from search results and the Content tab of folderish documents. It is not possible from the tag cloud.

**To change the information displayed in content lists:**

1.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='edit_columns.png' page='icons-index'}}).
    A pop-up is displayed: The right column shows selected information and the left column shows information that are currently not displayed.
    ![]({{file name='results-columns-popup.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
2.  Move information from one column to another using the horizontal arrows.
3.  You can reorder columns using the vertical arrows.
4.  Click on **Save**.
    The list of documents is updated to show the selected columns or pieces of information.

## Browsing Tips

Here are some tips on how to leverage all the navigation means provided by the Nuxeo Platform.

### Going Back to a Previous Page

Due to [technical reasons]({{page space='nxdoc60' page='back-and-next-buttons-paradigm-and-jsf-in-the-nuxeo-platform'}}), it is recommended to NOT use the browser's Back and Next buttons to navigate in the Platform. There are several ways to go back to a previous page.

To go up one level in the platform structure, the easiest way is to click on the icon ![]({{file name='UpFolder_icon.gif' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;in the breadcrumbs.

![]({{file name='breadcrumbs.png'}} ?border=true)

Users can also click on the workspace's title in the breadcrumbs directly or in the navigation tree. They can go up several levels in the document's path in a single click that way.

### Working with Several Documents at the Same Time

Users may want to have several Nuxeo documents open in different tabs in order to easily consult them at the same time or to work on several documents at the same time. Browsers provide a way to open documents in new tabs, but then some contextual information will be shared by all these tabs (all tabs use the same conversation). This can result in inconsistencies when modification on the documents are saved or when the user wants to navigate to another document. The Platform provides a safe way to open documents in new tabs, which is preferable to the browser's "Open in new tab".

To open documents in new tabs in order to have several Nuxeo tabs, click on the icon ![]({{file name='external.gif' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;displayed next to the document's title. The document is opened in a new tab and in a context that is independent from the original tab.

### Quick Access to Document's Features

#### Right-Click Menu

The Nuxeo Platform provides a contextual menu that enables users to access to the document's tabs in a single click instead of clicking on the document and then on the tab they want (the **Edit** tab for instance).

Right-clicking on the document displays this contextual menu and enables users to easily rename the document, access to the Workflow tab, lock the document, etc.
![]({{file name='right-click-menu.png' page='editing-content'}} ?w=350,border=true)

#### Access Keys

Some actions or features are accessible using access keys: For instance ctrl-shift-e displays the Edit tab of the document.

Press shift-h to see the different access keys you can combine with ctrl-shift keys to get a quick access to features.
