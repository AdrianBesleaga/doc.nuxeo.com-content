### Consulting a Picture

When you browse and search a picture, you just need to click on it in the list of asset to preview it on the right column of the page and consult its metadata. To see its full-size version, click on the icon ![]({{file name='preview.png' page='icons-index'}}). You can [annotate]({{page page='annotating-assets'}}) the picture from this view.

![]({{file name='DAM_search_blue.png' page='browsing-and-searching-assets'}} ?w=650,border=true)

### Consulting Office Documents

From the list of assets, click on an office document to see its metadata in the right column. No small preview is available in this column for office documents, but you can click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='preview.png' page='icons-index'}}) to have a full-size preview, on which you can add [annotations]({{page page='annotating-assets'}}).

### Consulting a Video Asset

When a video is imported, thumbnails that segment the video are automatically created to constitute a storyboard.

You can view the chapter you were looking for by clicking on the corresponding thumbnail.The video will play in the preview, starting at the image you selected.

![]({{file name='DAM-storyboard.png'}} ?w=350)

### {{> anchor 'asset-dm-view'}}Consulting the DM View of Assets

The Asset library domain in which assets are created is available from the Document Management tab. Assets are thus also available from this tab, with all the [Document Management features]({{page page='document-management'}}).

You can easily go to the DM view of the asset by clicking on the icon ![]({{file name='switch.png' page='icons-index'}}).

![]({{file name='asset-DM-view.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

## Consulting the Asset's Metadata

### Metadata

Some of the asset's metadata are automatically filled in by the system.

![]({{file name='DAM-metadata-view-mode.png'}} ?w=350)

_Picture metadata edit mode:_

![]({{file name='DAM-metadata-edit-mode.png'}} ?w=350)

### IPTC and EXIF Metadata

When assets are imported, the system extracts the metadata embedded in the resource if it exists:

*   EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) is a specification for the image file format used by digital cameras.
    ![]({{file name='EXIF.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
*   IPTC defines a set of metadata attributes that can be applied to text, images and other media types.
    ![]({{file name='iptc.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

These metadata cannot be edited.

### IP (Intellectual Property) Rights

Assets also have an **IP Rights** box, in which you can specify permissions for use of the file.

You can specify geographical restrictions for broadcast, copyright, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) Licence, embargo and expiration date.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The embargo and expiration date are only informative fields, there is no automatic process on those dates.

{{/callout}}

![]({{file name='IP-rights.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### History

The history of the asset is [available on its DM view]({{page page='documents-history'}}).

## Editing Assets

### Editing a single Asset's Metadata

You need to have at least "Write" permission to be able to edit the properties of an asset and enrich it.
When you edit an asset, you can modify its main metadata and its IP rights.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

The size, height, width and duration information are not editable.

{{/callout}}

**To edit an asset:**

1.  Click on an asset to preview it and see its metadata.
2.  Click on the **Edit** button of the Metadata box.
3.  Edit the information you wish.
4.  Click on the **Save** button.
    The new values are saved. The asset's history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.
5.  Click on the IP Rights&nbsp;**Edit** button if you want to edit them.
6.  Update the Intellectual properties information.
7.  Click on the&nbsp;**Save** button.
    The new values are saved. The asset's history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The metadata can also be [edited from the Document Management view]({{page page='editing-content'}}).

{{/callout}}

### Editing several assets

It is possible to edit the metadata of several assets at the same time. Like for editing a single asset, you need&nbsp;at least "Write" permission.

Note that the values you set from the bulk edit form will overwrite any value previously set on the documents, except for the tags, that will be added to the tags already set on the documents.

**To edit several assets metadata:**

1.  Select the assets you want to edit using the checkboxes.
2.  Click on the **Edit** button at the bottom of the list.
3.  On the bulk edit form, indicate the metadata the documents should now hold.
    ![]({{file name='dam-bulk-edit.png'}} ?w=550,h=456,border=true)
4.  Click on the **Update** button.
    The new values are saved and replace possible previous values.&nbsp;The assets' history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.&nbsp;A minor version of the assets is automatically created.
