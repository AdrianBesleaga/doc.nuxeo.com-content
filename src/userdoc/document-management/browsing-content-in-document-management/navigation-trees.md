## Virtual Navigation

{{#> callout type='info' heading='Virtual navigation availability'}}

Virtual navigation is available on the Document Management module.

{{/callout}}

Another way to access documents is using virtual navigation. Virtual navigation consists in using a navigation tree based on metadata to access documents. Metadata are information about the documents, like the document's theme for instance, or its last modification date.

By default, two virtual navigation trees are available in Nuxeo: geographical cover navigation tree and subject navigation tree. You can use them for instance to access all the documents about the IT subject.

![]({{file name='DM-virtual_navigation.png'}} ?border=true)

You can replace or edit existing virtual navigation trees with you organization's own vocabularies. Thus, you'll be able to adapt Nuxeo to your organization's structure and way of working.

See also pages [Editing the document's content and metadata]({{page page='editing-content'}}) and [managing vocabularies]({{page page='managing-vocabularies'}}).
