## Following a Document or the Activity of a Space

You need to have at least reading rights to follow a document or a space.

**To follow a document or a space activity:**
From the document or space, click on the icon ![]({{file name='subscribe.png' page='icons-index'}}).
The icon becomes green to indicate that you follow the document and, from now on, you will receive an email every time an event occurs on the document.
On the Home **Alerts** tab, the user can see all the events he will be alerted of and the associated documents.

## Unfollowing a Document or the Activity of a Space

You need to have at least reading rights to unfollow a document or a space. You can either unfollow the document and don't receive any email anymore, or you can unsubscribe from some events only.

{{/callout}}

**To unfollow a document or a space activity:**
