It is possible to compare two documents or two versions of a document to see the differences between documents or versions.

{{{multiexcerpt 'comparison-possibilities' page='Nuxeo Diff'}}}

The comparison features comes as a Marketplace addon on the naked Platform, called Nuxeo Diff. Since Nuxeo Platform 5.8, it is integrated by default in the Document Management module. Please refer to the [Nuxeo Diff documentation]({{page page='nuxeo-diff'}}) for a complete description of this feature.
