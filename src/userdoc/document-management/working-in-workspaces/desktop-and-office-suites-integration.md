To ease office documents integration, Nuxeo proposes two ways to create and edit documents from their native application.

*   **Nuxeo Live Edit** enables you to create and edit office documents in their native application from the Nuxeo Platform. Nuxeo Live Edit is available as an extension to be installed on the user's computer. It is available from Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org.
*   **Nuxeo WSS and WebDAV** enable you to work on Nuxeo's documents from your desktop directly. They don't require the installation of any extension.
