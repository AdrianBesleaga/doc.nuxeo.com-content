## Regular Folders

Regular folders, called "Folders", have the same behavior as workspaces. In a folder, you can:

*   Create documents and do all the actions available on them (edit, approve, manage relations, etc)
*   [Manage access rights]({{page page='managing-access-rights'}}),
*   [Subscribe to and manage alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}),
*   [Manage the folder's trash]({{page page='managing-deleted-documents'}}).

Like in a workspace, you can use [drag & drop]({{page page='working-using-drag-and-drop'}}) to create content in a folder.

## Ordered Folders

Ordered folders are folders in which you can change the content's order.

An ordered folder has the same presentation as a regular folder, but it has some additional buttons below the content table:

*   Move up
*   Move down
*   Move to top
*   Move to bottom

**To change the content's order:**

1.  Select a document using the checkbox on the left.
    The move buttons are available.
    ![]({{file name='DM-ordered-folder-content.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
2.  Click on the move button you need.
3.  The document is moved in the list of documents available in the folder.
    ![]({{file name='DM-ordered-folder-content-updated.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Moving documents restrictions'}}

You can move one document at a time. If you select more than one document, the move buttons will deactivate.
