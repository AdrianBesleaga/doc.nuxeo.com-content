## Managing Picture Books

Picture books are folders adapted to hold only pictures. As so, you have some specific parameters that you need to fill in when you create a picture book.
A picture book can only hold pictures and other picture books.

### Creating a Picture Book

You need to have at least Write right to be able to create a picture book.

**To create a picture book:**

{{{excerpt 'Creating content'}}}

**Picture book creation parameters**

<table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1">

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1">

Views

</td><td colspan="1">

Different views and formats available for the pictures available in the picture book.
Default views available are:

*   Thumbnail: view used for the default picture book content view,
*   Medium: intermediate size picture,
*   Original: original size picture,
*   OriginalJpeg: original size picture in .jpg format.

</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Editing a Picture Book

You need to have at least Write right to edit a picture book.
When you edit a picture book, you edit some of its properties: title, description and slideshow duration. You cannot edit the picture views available in the picture book.

**To edit a picture book:**

1.  Click on the **Edit** tab of the picture book.
2.  Edit the edition form's fields.
3.  Optionally type a comment to keep track of why you edited the picture book.
4.  Click on the **Save** button.
    Modifications are saved and the fact that you edited the picture book is tracked in **History** tab.

### Viewing the Content of a Picture Book

Beside the **Content** tab that enables the same features as in a workspace or a folder (selection of documents), a picture book has a **View** tab displays the book's content as thumbnails. It is the picture book's default tab. However, the regular **Content** tab used on all folderish content is available on picture book as well, to make it easy to have a synthetic view of the pictures author, versions, etc.

In the **View** tab of the picture book, click once on a picture to select it, click on it again to unselect it. Click twice on it to consult it. Selected pictures are displayed on an blue background.

![]({{file name='DM-pictureBook-view-selected.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

A **Slideshow** tab is also available on picture books, in which the pictures are displayed in a slideshow.

## Managing Pictures

Pictures can be created in picture book, in folders and in workspaces. You can add pictures using all document creation means:

*   [**New** button]({{page page='creating-content#new-button'}})
*   [**Import a file** button]({{page page='creating-content#import-button'}})
*   [Drag & Drop]({{page page='working-using-drag-and-drop'}}).

When pictures are created, the EXIF and IPTC metadata of the pictures are automatically extracted. You can consult them in the **Picture metadata** tab. EXIF and IPTC metadata are not editable.

![]({{file name='DM-pictureBook-picsMetadata.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)

When they are created, pictures are displayed in the **View** tab, that enables some picture management specific actions. Should the picture be wrongly oriented, you can rotate it using the right and left rotation buttons available on this tab. It is in this tab that you can see the different sizes available for the picture (sizes available are defined for the whole picture book) and download it in the format you need. Default size is medium size.

![]({{file name='DM-pictureBook-picView.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

Whatever the folder they have been created in, their behaviour and the actions available are the same: you will be able to [preview and annotate]({{page page='annotations-and-preview'}}) them, [link]({{page page='relations'}}) them to other documents, [tag]({{page page='tags'}}) them, [publish]({{page page='publishing-documents'}}) them and subscribe to [email alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}), etc.
