All the documents evolve according to a defined life cycle. The default life cycle is composed of the following states: Project, Approved, Obsolete and Deleted. There are different ways to make documents evolve through this life cycle. One of the ways is to use a workflow.

A workflow is a process in which a chain of users is defined to review, approve or reject the document. Workflows are traditionally used to validate documents (make them go to "Approved" state), but they can also be used to have the document reviewed, without life cycle state change.

The Nuxeo Platform includes two default workflows: one [serial workflow]({{page page='serial-document-workflow'}}) and one [parallel workflow]({{page page='parallel-document-workflow'}}). Other workflows can be [configured with Nuxeo Studio]({{page space='studio' page='workflow'}}), which will then be available in the application.

{{{excerpt 'Parallel Document Workflow'}}}

Users who are involved in workflows are alerted by email and can have a synthetic view of all the tasks they have to do on documents in their [dashboard]({{page page='navigation-trees#dashboard'}}). The documents they have to review are listed there.
