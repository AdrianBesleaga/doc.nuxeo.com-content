<span style="color: rgb(51,51,51);">When you know you might not be able to perform a task, you can delegate it to another user or group of users. Delegating means that they can do the task at your place, but you are not unassigned the task. As soon as you or a delegatee reviews the document, the task is closed for you and all the delegatees.</span>

You can delegate a task from:

*   The Process view of the tasks in the Home Workflow tab,
*   The Workflow tab of the document.

**To delegate the task from the Home Workflow tab:**

1.  Click on the&nbsp;**Process**&nbsp;button of the task to delegate.
2.  In the&nbsp;**More**&nbsp;menu in the top right corner, click on&nbsp;**Delegate task**.
    The delegation form is displayed in a pop-up.
    ![]({{file name='delegation-form.png' page='participating-to-a-parallel-workflow'}} ?w=450,border=true)
3.  In the Actors field, type the name of a user or group.
4.  Click on the user or group you want to delegate the task to.
5.  Optionally repeat these steps as many times as you want to delegate the task.
6.  Optionally type a comment for the delegatees.
7.  Click on the&nbsp;**Delegate**&nbsp;button.
    You are displayed the&nbsp;**My tasks**&nbsp;tab of the&nbsp;**Workflow**&nbsp;tab.
    If you click on the task Process button, you can see the list of delegatees displayed on the task.

**To delegate a task from the document's Workflow tab:**

1.  Click on the&nbsp;**Delegate task**&nbsp;button displayed in the top left corner of the task.
2.  The delegation form is displayed in a pop-up.
    ![]({{file name='delegation-form.png' page='participating-to-a-parallel-workflow'}} ?w=450,border=true)
3.  In the Actors field, type the name of a user or group.

5.  Optionally repeat these steps as many times as you want to delegate the task.
