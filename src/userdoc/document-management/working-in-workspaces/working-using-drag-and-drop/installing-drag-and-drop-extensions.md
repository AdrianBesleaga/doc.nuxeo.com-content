If you're using Firefox, no extension is needed to work with Drag and Drop, unless you're using a version older than 3.6.
If you're using Internet Explorer, you need to install an extension to be able to create documents using drag and drop.
For other browsers, drag and drop is automatically enabled if you're using a recent version that supports the HTML 5 standard.

## Installing Internet Explorer Extension

To make drag and drop available on Internet Explorer, you need to install the Internet Explorer extension.

The extension is available in two formats:

*   [.exe extension](http://download.nuxeo.org/desktop-integration/drag-drop/msie/Nuxeo-MSIEBrowserExtension-latest-stable.exe): includes the drag and drop package and the needed dependencies (required for Windows 2000)
*   [.msi extension](http://download.nuxeo.org/desktop-integration/drag-drop/msie/Nuxeo-MSIEBrowserExtension-latest-stable.msi): includes only the drag and drop package

To install the Internet Explorer extension, follow the instructions of the installer. Installation should be done for everyone, not just for the current user.

## Installing Firefox Extension

If you're using a version older than Firefox 3.6, you need to install [the Firefox drag and drop extension](https://updates.nuxeo.org/desktop-integration/drag-drop/firefox/nuxeo-dragdrop-ff-extension.xpi). From Firefox 3.6, the HTML 5 drag and drop is automatically enabled.

It comes as a standard Firefox add-on. Installing process is the same as the other available Firefox add-ons: click on the link above and follow the instructions.
