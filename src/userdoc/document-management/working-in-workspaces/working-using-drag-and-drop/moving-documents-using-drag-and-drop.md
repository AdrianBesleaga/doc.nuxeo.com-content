It is possible to move documents and publish them using drag and drop. Based on JavaScript these features are available on all JS-compatible browsers.

Usually documents are moved [using the worklist or the clipboard]({{page page='copying-and-moving-documents'}}). But you can also quickly move documents individually from a workspace to another using drag and drop.

1.  Go in the workspace where the document to move is located.
2.  Unfold the navigation so the target workspace is visible.
3.  Drag the icon of the document to move onto the target workspace in the navigation tree until the workspace is highlighted, and drop the document icon.
    ![]({{file name='move-d&d.png' page='copying-and-moving-documents'}} ?w=500,h=385,border=true)
    The document is immediately moved.
