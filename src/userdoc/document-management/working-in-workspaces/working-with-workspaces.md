There are two types of workspaces:

*   _shared workspaces_ are workspaces meant for collaborative work, that is to say that the workspace's content is meant to be shared and modified by several users. Collaborative workspaces are workspaces created in the root space called **Workspaces** and shared between users. Once documents are ready for distribution, they must be published in a section.

*   _personal workspaces_ can only be accessed by their owner, by default. You can of course share the access to your personal workspace with other users. Personal workspaces are accessible in the header of the application.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Personal workspaces behaviour'}}

Content creation and edition, as well as management, works the same way in personal workspaces as in collaborative workspaces.

{{/callout}}

By default, no workspace is available at workspaces root. Thus, you can create the structure you need for your project, edit it if needed. You can also [set the appropriate access right]({{page page='managing-access-rights'}}) for users to be able to collaborate in the workspaces.

Workspaces management also includes setting [alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}) for users to be informed when content is created or edited in workspaces and handling content deletion.
