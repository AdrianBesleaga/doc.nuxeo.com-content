## Creating a Workspace from Scratch

To create a new workspace, you need to have at least 'Write' rights in the parent folder.

**To create a workspace:**

1.  Click on the **New Document** button (**New Workspace** if you are the root of workspaces).
2.  On the Available document types window, click on **Workspace**.
3.  Give the workspace a title and possibly a description.
4.  Click on **Create** button.
    The workspace's **Content** tab is displayed.
    ![]({{file name='workspace-saved.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

## Creating a Workspace from a Template

Templates are predefined workspaces that you can use to make building your workspace structure easier.

When you create a workspace from a template, the newly created workspace automatically have the same content and description as its template. Access rights however are not inherited from the template but from the parent workspace.

**To create a workspace from a template:**

1.  Click on the **New Document** button (**New Workspace** if you are the root of workspaces).
2.  On the Available document types window, click on **Workspace**.
3.  Give the workspace a title, possibly a description and select the template to create the workspace from in the drop down list.
4.  Click on **Create** button.
    The workspace's **Content** tab is displayed.
