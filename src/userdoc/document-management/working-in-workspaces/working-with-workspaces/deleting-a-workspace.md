Only users with "write" or "manage everything" rights in the parent workspace can delete a workspace.

When you delete a workspace, you also delete its content. This action moves the workspace into the parent's trash, from which users with management rights can [revert deletion]({{page page='managing-deleted-documents#restore-documents'}}) or [delete it permanently]({{page page='managing-deleted-documents#permanently-delete-documents'}}).

**To delete a workspace:**

1.  In the **Content** tab of the parent workspace, check the box corresponding to the workspace to delete.
2.  Click on the **Delete** button.
3.  In the window that pops up, click on the **OK** button.
    The parent workspace's **Content** tab is displayed: the deleted workspace is not displayed anymore.
