To edit a workspace, you need to have Write right on the workspace.

When you edit a workspace, you can edit its properties (title and description) and its metadata. The metadata of workspaces are the same as for all the other documents:

{{!-- unmigrated-wiki-markup: {multi-excerpt-include:Editing content|name=metadata|nopanel=true} --}}

**To edit a workspace:**

1.  Click on the **Edit** tab of the workspace.
2.  Fill in the edition form's fields.
    ![]({{file name='workspace_edit_form.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
3.  Optionally type a comment to keep track of why you edited the workspace.
4.  Click on the **Save** button.
    Modifications are saved and the fact that you edited the workspace is tracked in **History** tab.
