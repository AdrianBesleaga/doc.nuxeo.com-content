## Available Documents

### Domain

Sections, workspaces and templates are grouped in&nbsp;**domains**. A domain can be considered as a mini-application in Nuxeo or a root in the application. Typically, you can use domains to open the application to two or more very different populations of users. For instance, you can have an "intranet" domain and an "extranet" domain. Domains can be totally independent or not, depending on the permissions you set on each domain.

### Workspace

{{! multiexcerpt name='definition-workspace'}}

There are two types of workspaces:

*   _shared workspaces_&nbsp;are workspaces meant for collaborative work, that is to say that the workspace's content is meant to be shared and modified by several users. Collaborative workspaces are workspaces created in the root space called&nbsp;**Workspaces**&nbsp;and shared between users. Once documents are ready for distribution, they must be published in a section.

*   _personal workspaces_&nbsp;can only be accessed by their owner, by default. You can of course share the access to your personal workspace with other users. Personal workspaces are accessible in the header of the application.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Personal workspaces behaviour'}}

Content creation and edition, as well as management, works the same way in personal workspaces as in collaborative workspaces.

{{/callout}}

By default, no workspace is available at workspaces root. Thus, you can create the structure you need for your project, edit it if needed. You can also&nbsp;[set the appropriate permission]({{page page='managing-permissions'}})&nbsp;for users to be able to collaborate in the workspaces.

Workspaces management also includes setting&nbsp;[alerts]({{page page='collaborative-features#alerts'}})&nbsp;for users to be informed when content is created or edited in workspaces and handling content deletion.

{{! /multiexcerpt}}

### Folder

In workspaces, you can create and manage your documents in folders. A folder works like a workspace, but the documents available for creation are limited.&nbsp;In a folder, you can create: Notes, Files, Collections and Sub-folders.&nbsp;

{{! excerpt}}

There are two types of folders: regular folders and ordered folders. The difference between the two folder types is the way content is sorted.

{{! /excerpt}}

**Regular Folders**

Regular folders, called "Folders", have the same behavior as workspaces.&nbsp;In a regular folder, documents are sorted on the title by default. You can change the sort criterion by clicking on the content table columns title. You can thus sort them on their state, author, etc.&nbsp;In a folder, you can:

*   [Create documents]({{page page='creating-content'}})&nbsp;and do all the actions available on them (edit, approve, manage relations, etc),
*   [Manage permissions]({{page page='managing-permissions'}}),
*   [Subscribe to and manage alerts]({{page page='collaborative-features#alerts'}}),
*   [Manage the folder's trash]({{page page='deleting-content'}}).

Like in a workspace, you can use&nbsp;drag & drop&nbsp;to create content in a folder.

**Ordered Folders**

In an ordered folder, documents are manually sorted. So, the orders in which documents are listed in the folder doesn't depend on one of its properties (version, author, etc); you decide where it should be displayed in the list. When a document is created, it is added at the end of the list. It is not possible to sort documents automatically by clicking on the columns titles in an ordered folder.

An ordered folder has the same presentation as a regular folder, but it has some additional buttons below the content table:

*   Move up
*   Move down
*   Move to top
*   Move to bottom

To change the content's order, select a document using the checkbox on the left and click on the **move** button you need.&nbsp;The document is moved in the list of documents available in the folder.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Moving documents restrictions'}}

You can move one document at a time. If you select more than one document, the move buttons will deactivate.

{{/callout}}

### File

{{! excerpt}}

A file document is a basic binary container and is composed of an attached file that you upload on the application. You can upload files of any format.

{{! /excerpt}}

A file is composed of:

*   A title (mandatory),
*   A description (optional),
*   An attached file.

![]({{file name='file-summary.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

To create a file, in the&nbsp;**Content**&nbsp;tab of the workspace, click on the&nbsp;**New**&nbsp;button.&nbsp;On the window **Available document types**, click on the desired document.&nbsp;Fill in the document's creation form and click on the **Create**&nbsp;button.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Other ways to create a file'}}

You can also create a file using the[ **Import** button]({{page page='creating-content#import-button'}}) or using [drag and drop]({{page page='creating-content'}}).

{{/callout}}

When the file is created, users can enhance it by&nbsp;[filling its metadata]({{page page='editing-content'}}), adding attached files on it. When the document is completed, you can&nbsp;[publish]({{page page='publishing-content'}})&nbsp;it in one or several section(s).

### Note

{{! excerpt}}

The note is a basic rich text container that consists in a text displayed in the **Summary** tab of the document. The note is usually created using the integrated rich editor, displayed in the note creation form. This editor enables layout modifications on the text.

{{! /excerpt}}

&nbsp;

![]({{file name='note.png'}} ?w=600,h=384,border=true)

The default format of the note is HTML. The other formats available are .txt, .xml and Markdown.

A note is composed of the fields below:

<table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1">

Field

</th><th colspan="1">

Description

</th></tr><tr><td colspan="1">

Title

</td><td colspan="1">

Note's title

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1">

Description

</td><td colspan="1">

Text that explains what the note is about.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1">

Content

</td><td colspan="1">

Text of the note created using a rich text editor.

</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1">

Format

</td><td colspan="1">

Format of the automatically created file used to export notes from the Nuxeo Platform.

</td></tr></tbody></table>

To create a note, in the&nbsp;**Content**&nbsp;tab of the workspace, click on the&nbsp;**New**&nbsp;button.&nbsp;On the window&nbsp;**Available document types**, click on the desired document, fill in the document's creation form and click on the&nbsp;**Create**&nbsp;button.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Other ways to create a note'}}

You can also create a note by importing a .txt, a .html or a .xml file using [ **Import** button]({{page page='creating-content#import-button'}}) or [drag and drop]({{page page='creating-content'}}).

{{/callout}}

When the note is created, users can enhance it by adding&nbsp;[comments]({{page page='collaborative-features#comments'}}), attached files on it, or just&nbsp;[editing it]({{page page='editing-content'}}).

### Attachment

It is possible to add attachments to&nbsp;Files&nbsp;and&nbsp;Notes&nbsp;using the&nbsp;**Files**&nbsp;tab. This tab is available to users with at least Edit permission. There is no limit to the number of attachments.

For more information about attachment documents, read the page [Attachments]({{page page='attachments'}}).&nbsp;

### Collections

{{! excerpt}}

Collections are a folder-like document in which you can classify existing documents. Documents are not actually copied or moved into the collection, which only holds a link to the document in its original location.

{{! /excerpt}}

It enables you to create your own organization of the content without duplicating content and having the size of the content growing uncontrollably.

The list of collections available to you is available from your Home, in the&nbsp;**Collections**&nbsp;tab.![]({{file name='collection-home-tab.png' page='collections'}} ?w=650,border=true)

### Section

When documents are finished and ready, they are published in **sections**. Traditionally opened to a wider audience than workspaces, sections are dedicated to content distribution and communication and are designed for content consultation. That is why users cannot change documents (edit or move them) in sections: documents published in sections are frozen versions of workspace documents. [Publishing]({{page page='publishing-content'}})&nbsp;is controlled using a workflow, that requires publishing requests to be [approved]({{page page='publishing-content'}})&nbsp;so documents can be seen in sections.

### Workspace Template

Templates are the easiest way to automate the creation of workspace tree structures. This is useful in many cases, for example when:

*   you have many workspaces to create and want them to follow a certain structure of Folders, Files, or any type of documents (Forum, etc).
*   you want to keep a consistency among different workspaces that users will create. For example, you may want each team's workspace to have a mail folder, a "projects" workspace, etc.

To **create a template**, click on the left panel of Nuxeo Platform on&nbsp;**Templates**.&nbsp;Once a new Template has been created, you can&nbsp;create many workspaces from this template.

### Forum

{{! excerpt}}

A forum is a discussion space in which users can talk together. A forum is organized around different topics, in which users can add comments. Topics and comments are displayed in threads. You can create forums only in workspaces.

{{! /excerpt}}

As for workspaces and sections, the access to a forum is defined by permissions. However, in the case of a&nbsp;[moderated topic]({{page page='managing-topics#topic-moderation'}}), some users are declared "moderators" and are in charge of the approval of the topic content.

Users with "Edit" and "Manage" permissions&nbsp;can create and edit forums and also manage the forum like a workspace, i.e.&nbsp;[give users permissions]({{page page='managing-permissions'}}), set&nbsp;[alerts]({{page page='collaborative-features#alerts'}})&nbsp;and manage the forum's&nbsp;[trash]({{page page='deleting-content'}}).

To **create a forum,** in the **Content**&nbsp;tab of the workspace, click on the **New** button.&nbsp;On the window&nbsp;**Available document types**, click on Forum, fill in the document's creation form and click on the&nbsp;**Create**&nbsp;button.&nbsp;The forum is created. You can now create topics to start discussing.

![]({{file name='forum-saved.png' page='forums'}} ?w=650,border=true)

To **edit a forum**, on the forum, click on the&nbsp;**Edit**&nbsp;tab.&nbsp;Modify the title or the description of the forum. You can also add a comment explaining what you edited on the forum and click on the **Save** button.

&nbsp;

### Picture&nbsp;

Pictures are specific files. To take into account the specificities of pictures, their Summary tab shows additional pieces of information, such as:

*   Rotate actions
*   The picture's EXIF metadata
*   Additional picture views

For more information about picture document, take a look to the [Digital Asset Management page]({{page page='digital-asset-management-with-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).&nbsp;

### Video

Video is a document types dedicated to the management of videos files. It provides the following specific features: A player to view the video from the application, a storyboard to navigate in the video and alternative video formats.

For more information about video document, take a look to the&nbsp;[Digital Asset Management page]({{page page='digital-asset-management-with-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).&nbsp;

### Audio

Audio is a document types dedicated to audio files management. It provides a player from the document **Summary** tab to listen to it from the application.

Audio documents can be [created]({{page page='creating-content'}}) and [edited]({{page page='editing-content'}}) like any other document type. They don't have any specific tab or action available.

For more information about audio document, take a look to the&nbsp;[Digital Asset Management page]({{page page='digital-asset-management-with-the-nuxeo-platform'}}).&nbsp;

## Documents Evolution

The evolution of a document, each time contributors edit it, constitutes its life cycle. This life cycle is composed of the following states:

*   **Project**: the document has been created and it can be modified;
*   **Approved**: the document has been approved and is considered as valid. Modifying it makes it back to project life cycle state;
*   **Obsolete**: the document is not accurate anymore and, for instance, has been replaced by a new version;
*   **Deleted**: the document is moved into the workspace or folder trash.

To change the life cycle state of a document, you need to submit it to a [workflow]({{page page='workflows'}}).

## Containers Logic

When a document is folderish this means its a container&nbsp;in which you can create other documents (workspaces, folders, etc. are folderish documents).

It is possible to implement rules on containers to integrate&nbsp;the business logic of your application. In Nuxeo Studio when you select the folderish document facet, you have to choose which children are accepted in this document type. For example, in a folderish document type Library, if I have Edit&nbsp;permissions I can only create a children type Book in it.&nbsp;
