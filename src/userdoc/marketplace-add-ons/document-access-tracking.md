{{! excerpt}}

The [Document access tracking package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/audit-web-access) is used to register in the document's history the fact that users have accessed the document, and so have probably read it.

{{! /excerpt}}

It adds actions done by the server. You do not have any action to do so the access to documents is logged.
Just like there is a new line in the event log every time the document is modified, there will be a line added when users click on the document to consult it.

In this **History** tab, when a user clicks on the document, a new event is registered, called "Access". It is indicated the user who opened the document and the date and time at which he/she accessed it.
