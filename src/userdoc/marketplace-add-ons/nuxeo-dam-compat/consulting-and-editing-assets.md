{{{multiexcerpt 'DeprecatedAddOn_6.0' page='NXDOC60:Generic Multi-Excerpts'}}}

This page describes the information available on the different assets types, and how to consult and edit them.

## Consulting Assets

Users can see assets when they have at least "Read" permission on the folder in which the asset is located. By default, assets are created at the root of the Asset library domain, but they can be [reorganized in folders from the Document Management interface]({{page page='copying-and-moving-documents'}}).

To consult assets, you can either:

*   Click on their thumbnail, to access their full screen view (available for pictures only),
*   Click on their title to access their metadata and actions (available for all asset types).

### Full Screen View

A full screen view is available for pictures. When you click on the picture thumbnail, the picture is displayed in full screen. You can navigate to the previous and next pictures using the left and right arrow keys. If the list of assets is displayed on several pages, browsing pictures in full screen mode will automatically switch to the next or previous page when you press the right or left arrow key.

If other types of assets are listed, they are skipped in full screen view when you navigate between assets.

### Asset Detailed View

When you click on an asset title, you have access to the information and actions below:

*   Metadata: the set of metadata that correspond to the asset type (see below):

    *   [Generic ](#metadata)[undefined](#metadata): same set of metadata as in Document Management;
    *   [EXIF and IPTC metadata](#iptc-and-exif-metadata): picture specific metadata, extracted automatically;
    *   [Storyboard](#consulting-a-video-asset): thumbnails that segment videos;
    *   [IP rights information](#ip-intellectual-property-rights): information about permissions for use of the asset;
*   Like,
*   Asset preview: full-size view of the asset from which you can [annotate]({{page page='annotating-assets'}}) the asset;
*   Locking,
*   Download,
*   Permanent link to the asset,
*   Follow the asset: [get email notifications]({{page page='alerts'}}) to follow what happens on the asset;
*   [Add the asset to the worklist ]({{page page='copying-and-moving-documents'}}) to easily copy, move or export it;
*   Document management view of the asset, to have access to complete document management features ([history]({{page page='documents-history'}}), [relations]({{page page='relations'}}), [publishing]({{page page='publishing-documents'}})),
*   Print view of the asset.

![]({{file name='asset-view.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### Consulting a Picture

When you browse and search a picture, you just need to click on its thumbnail to see it full screen or click on its title to preview it on the right column of the page and consult its metadata.

To see its full-size version, click on the icon ![]({{file name='preview.png' page='icons-index'}}). You can [annotate]({{page page='annotating-assets'}}) the picture from this view.

![]({{file name='DAM_search_blue.png' page='browsing-and-searching-assets'}} ?w=600,border=true)

### Consulting Office Documents

From the list of assets, click on an office document to see its metadata in the right column. No small preview is available in this column for office documents, but you can click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='preview.png' page='icons-index'}}) to have a full-size preview, on which you can add [annotations]({{page page='annotating-assets'}}).

### Consulting a Video Asset

When a video is imported, thumbnails that segment the video are automatically created to constitute a storyboard.

You can view the chapter you were looking for by clicking on the corresponding thumbnail.The video will play in the preview, starting at the image you selected.

![]({{file name='DAM-storyboard.png'}} ?w=350)

### {{> anchor 'asset-dm-view'}}Consulting the DM View of Assets

The Asset library domain in which assets are created is available from the Document Management tab. Assets are thus also available from this tab, with all the Document Management features.

You can easily go to the DM view of the asset by clicking on the icon ![]({{file name='switch.png' page='icons-index'}}).

![]({{file name='asset-DM-view.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

## Consulting the Asset's Metadata

### Metadata

Some of the asset's metadata are automatically filled in by the system.

_Picture metadata view mode:_

![]({{file name='DAM-metadata-view-mode.png'}} ?w=350)

_Picture metadata edit mode:_

![]({{file name='DAM-metadata-edit-mode.png'}} ?w=350)

### IPTC and EXIF Metadata

When assets are imported, the system extracts the metadata embedded in the resource if it exists:

*   EXIF (Exchangeable image file format) is a specification for the image file format used by digital cameras.
    ![]({{file name='EXIF.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
*   IPTC defines a set of metadata attributes that can be applied to text, images and other media types.
    ![]({{file name='iptc.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

These metadata cannot be edited.

### IP (Intellectual Property) Rights

Assets also have an **IP Rights** box, in which you can specify permissions for use of the file.

You can specify geographical restrictions for broadcast, copyright, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) Licence, embargo and expiration date.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The embargo and expiration date are only informative fields, there is no automatic process on those dates.

{{/callout}}

![]({{file name='IP-rights.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)

### History

The history of the asset is [available on its DM view]({{page page='documents-history'}}).

## Editing Assets

### Editing an Asset's Metadata

You need to have at least "Write" permission to be able to edit the properties of an asset and enrich it.
When you edit an asset, you can modify its main metadata and its IP rights.

{{#> callout type='note' }}

The size, height, width and duration information are not editable.

{{/callout}}

**To edit an asset:**

1.  Click on an asset to preview it and see its metadata.
2.  Click on the **Edit** button of the Metadata box.
3.  Edit the information you wish.
4.  Click on the **Save** button.
    The new values are saved. The asset's history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.
5.  Click on the IP Rights&nbsp;**Edit** button if you want to edit them.
6.  Update the Intellectual properties information.
7.  Click on the button **Save**.
    The new values are saved. The asset's history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The Main metadata can also be [edited from the Document Management view]({{page page='editing-content'}}).

{{/callout}}

### Editing several assets

It is possible to edit the metadata of several assets at the same time. Like for editing a single asset, you need&nbsp;at least "Write" permission.

Note that the values you set from the bulk edit form will overwrite any value previously set on the documents.

**To edit several assets metadata:**

1.  Select the assets you want to edit using the checkboxes.
2.  Click on the&nbsp;**Edit**&nbsp;button at the bottom of the list.
3.  On the bulk edit form, indicate the metadata the documents should now hold.
    ![]({{file name='dam-bulk-edit.png'}} ?w=550,h=456,border=true)
4.  Click on the&nbsp;**Update**&nbsp;button.
    The new values are saved and replace possible previous values.&nbsp;The assets' history is updated and the fact that you edited the asset is tracked.&nbsp;A minor version of the assets is automatically created, except for the tags, that will be added to the tags already set on the documents.
