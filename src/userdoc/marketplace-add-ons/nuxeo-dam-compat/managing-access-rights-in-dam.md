{{{multiexcerpt 'DeprecatedAddOn_6.0' page='NXDOC60:Generic Multi-Excerpts'}}}

Access to documents and the actions allowed are determined by access rights on the Asset library domain and the DAM folders. Some users will then be allowed to only read documents, when others will be able to edit documents or to manage folders and documents. The management of the access rights is done from the **Document Management** tab of the application, in the **Asset Library** domain that contains the DAM folders.

The DAM permissions are:

{{!-- unmigrated-wiki-markup: {multi-excerpt-include:Digital Asset Management Concepts|name=DAM-access-rights|nopanel=true} --}}

To manage access rights on a DAM folder, you can :

1.  In the **DAM** tab, from an asset click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='switch.png' page='icons-index'}}) to go the DM view of the asset.
2.  Click on the icon ![]({{file name='UpFolder_icon.gif' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;to go the parent folder of the asset that you want to set access rights on.
3.  Add or Remove access rights following the [same steps as on a workspace]({{page page='managing-access-rights'}}).

You can also directly browse the the **Asset library** domain in the **Document Management** tab to the space you want to grant or deny access.
