{{! excerpt}}

The [Nuxeo Sites and Blogs package](https://connect.nuxeo.com/nuxeo/site/marketplace/package/nuxeo-sites-blogs) provides two new documents types to the Platform: websites and blogs.[ Websites]({{page page='websites'}}) and [Blogs]({{page page='blogs'}}) are collaborative documents that are web publishing oriented. As so, they have a second interface that makes it easy to display the documents of a workspace to the public. These specific presentations are built using [Nuxeo WebEngine]({{page space='nxdoc58' page='webengine-jax-rs'}}).

Websites and blogs have in common some specific behaviors, like the fact that they have some specific access rights and that comments can be moderated. Both can also be created in workspaces only.
