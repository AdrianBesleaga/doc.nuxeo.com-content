Along with [websites]({{page page='websites'}}), the Document Management module of the Nuxeo Platform includes blogs. Like websites, blogs are documents that make it easy to display your comments and documents, in reverse-chronological order. And like websites, they are available via a WebEngine interface, that takes into account all the characteristics of a blog.

![]({{file name='DM-blog-view.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

Blogs are accessible by a URL formed like [http://server:8080/nuxeo/site/blogs/blog-name](http://server:8080/nuxeo/site/blogs/blog-name). Click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='switch.png' page='icons-index'}}) to open the front office view of the blog.

## Adding Content to Your Blog

In a blog, you can create blog posts and contextual links.

### Adding a Blog Post

Blog posts are all created at the root of the blog. They are then automatically sorted by creation date in the left menu of the blog.

You need "Write" permission to be able to create blog posts. You can create them from the blog's back-office (Document Management interface) or from the blog's interface.

**To create a blog post:**

1.  From the blog's homepage, click on the button **Create entry**.
2.  Fill in the creation form:
    *   Title: type the name of your post.
    *   Description: type a text describing what the post is about.
    *   Content: type the content of your post in the editor.
3.  Click on the button **Save**
    The post is immediately created and displayed. It is also displayed in the last blog posts.

### Adding a Contextual Link

Contextual links are links displayed on the blog's home page.
They can be added from the blog's back-office only.

**To add a contextual link:**

1.  On the **Content** tab of the blog from the back-office interface, click on the **New** button.
2.  On the modal window displayed, click on **Contextual link**.
3.  Fill in the creation form:
    *   Title: type the text on which the user will click to open the link.
    *   Description: type an optional text describing why you add this link. The description is displayed on the blog's interface.
    *   Link: type the URL of the link.
4.  Click on the button **Create**.
    The link is created and its **Summary** tab is displayed.
    In the blog's interface, the link is displayed in the right column.
