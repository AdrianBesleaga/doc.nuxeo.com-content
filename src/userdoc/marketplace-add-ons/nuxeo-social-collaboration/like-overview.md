{{{multiexcerpt 'nuxeo_social_collaboration_deprecated' page='Nuxeo Social Collaboration'}}}

The Like feature enables users to vote for documents using a like / unlike system. The rating of the document is displayed on its Summary tab.

The Like feature is included by default in the Social Collaboration and Digital Asset Management modules. A dedicated gadget comes with Social Collaboration to enable users to see the most popular documents, providing another way to find documents.

Users can like documents, messages and activities.
For message and activities likes, see the [Wall Overview]({{page page='wall-overview'}}) page.

## Voting for a Document

Users need the **Read** right to vote for a document. They can vote for documents from the document's Summary tab or from the Document Library gadget in social workspaces.

**To vote for a document from the Summary tab:**
Click on the&nbsp;icon ![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}}).
Your vote is added to the current document rating. The icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}}).

**To vote for a document from the Document Library gadget:**
Click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;displayed below the document in the gadget.

![]({{file name='like-doc-library-gadget.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

Your vote is added to the current document rating. The icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}}).

![]({{file name='like-doc-library-gadget-liked.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

## Voting against a Document

It is not possible to vote against a document. Users can only unlike the documents they have voted for, by following the same steps as to vote for a document. Clicking**&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}})**&nbsp;removes their vote from the document's rating.
