{{{multiexcerpt 'nuxeo_social_collaboration_deprecated' page='Nuxeo Social Collaboration'}}}

The members of a social workspace can create and edit content in the workspace.

The documents that can be create in a social workspaces are:

*   Files,
*   Articles,
*   Events,
*   Folders.

{{#> callout type='info' }}

{{/callout}}

Articles are the main document type in social workspaces. All documents can be created either from the collaboration view or the document management view.

There are several ways to create articles:

*   [Using the complete creation form](#complete-article-creation),
*   [Using the quick creation form the workspace's dashboard](#quick-article-creation),
*   [Using the regular document management interface](#article-creation-from-dm-view).

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Initial versioning of documents in public social workspaces'}}

In public social workspaces, documents created as public automatically go into version 0.1, since they are automatically published. Private documents are created in version 0.0.

{{/callout}}

{{> anchor 'complete-article-creation'}} **To create an article using the complete form:**

1.  From the dashboard of the social workspace or an article, click on the **Actions** button.
2.  Click on **Create an article**.
3.  Fill in the article creation form (see below for article's properties).
    ![]({{file name='article_creation.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
4.  Click on **Create**.
    The article's collaboration view is displayed.
    ![]({{file name='article_created.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)

    {{#> callout type='tip' }}
