The Nuxeo Platform distinguishes collaborative work and content distribution.

The general concept is this: documents are created, edited, possibly approved in workspaces. When finished, they are published in sections. When obsolete, they're unpublished from sections. Actions users can perform on documents are determined by access rights given by spaces managers.

## Available spaces

### Tabs

Tabs are available on top of the page, that give access to different environments.

*   The **Home** tab is where the user can find all the information that concern him: his dashboard to get a quick access to documents, and that he can customize with internal and external gadgets, the summary of his notification subscriptions, see his profile, etc.
    ![]({{file name='CAP-dashboard.png' page='browsing-content'}} ?w=600,border=true)
*   The **Workspace** tab is the main tab. This is where the majority of user's activity within the Nuxeo Platform will occur since it's where users can work on documents and browse the application domains, workspace, sections, etc.

    {{#> callout type='info' }}

    Users need to have Read access to the root of at least one domain (typically Default domain) to be able to use this tab to browse the application. When users only have access to a workspace or a section, they can only access their dashboard and navigate to their documents from there.

    {{/callout}}

    ![]({{file name='members_tabs.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

*   The **Admin** tab is displayed only to administrators and enables them to manage the application.
    ![]({{file name='admin_tabs.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

### Workspaces

Collaborative work takes place in **workspaces**, where users can [create]({{page page='creating-content'}}) and [edit documents]({{page page='editing-content'}}). [Workspaces]({{page page='working-in-workspaces'}}) are designed to make capture, sharing and editing of documents easier using desktop integration features and [comments]({{page page='comments'}}). In the mean time, [documents history and versioning]({{page page='documents-history'}}), [relations]({{page page='relations'}}), [workflows]({{page page='workflows'}}) and [alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}) enable you to build a coherent and controlled documents structure.

### Templates

To help users create the workspaces in which they work, you can create workspaces **templates** and prepare the structure that will be applied to workspaces used in [template-based workspaces]({{page page='working-with-workspaces#template-based-workspace-creation'}}).

### Sections

When documents are finished and ready, they are published in **sections**. Traditionally opened to a wider audience than workspaces, sections are dedicated to content distribution and communication and are designed for content consultation. That is why users cannot change documents (edit or move them) in sections: documents published in sections are frozen versions of workspace documents.[ Publishing]({{page page='publishing-documents'}}) is controlled using a workflow, that requires publishing requests to be [approved]({{page page='publishing-documents#approve-document-publishing'}}) so documents can be seen in sections.

### Domains

Sections, workspaces and templates are grouped in **domains**. A domain can be considered as a mini-application in the Nuxeo Platform or a root in the application. Typically, you can use domains to open the application to two or more very different populations of users. For instance, you can have an "intranet" domain and an "extranet" domain. Domains can be totally independent or not, depending on the access rights you set on each domain.

## Access Rights {{> anchor 'rights'}}

Access to documents and the actions allowed are determined by access rights. Some users will then be allowed to only read documents, when others will be able to edit documents or to manage spaces and documents.

The available access rights are:

Remove

</td><td colspan="1">

Delete documents (this permission is included in **Write** right)

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The Remove permission is mainly intended to be denied, so as to restrict the actions available to users with "Write" permission.

{{/callout}}</td><td colspan="1">

{{#> callout type='tip' }}

The "Remove" permission is intended to be denied, so as to restrict the actions available to users with "Write" permission.

</td><td colspan="1">

&nbsp;

</td><td colspan="1">

&nbsp;

</td></tr></tbody></table></div>{{! /excerpt}}

Access rights are given on folderish spaces (workspaces, sections, templates, domains, but also folders and forum) and are inherited in the sub-spaces.

{{#> callout type='info' }}

On a standard Nuxeo Platform application, members are all granted "read" right at the application's root by default.

{{/callout}}

## Groups of Users

{{! multiexcerpt name='groups-intro'}}

To make access rights management easier, you can [create groups of users]({{page page='managing-users-and-groups'}}). Instead of giving (or denying) access rights to single users and repeat the same operations several times, you can give several users the same right in one single manipulation by using a group.

Default groups are:

*   **members**: Users in this group are the end-users users of the application.
*   **power users**: Users in this group are the functional administrators of the application. They have a restricted access to the Admin tab, the administration user interface of the Nuxeo Platform, from which they can manage users and groups and edit the vocabularies.
*   **administrators**: Users in this group are the technical administrators of the application. They have access to all the Admin tab features and are in charge of managing the application.
