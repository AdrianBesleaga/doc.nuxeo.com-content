Activity streams are feeds that display the latest events done by users. There are three activity streams:

## Social Workspace Activity Stream

The social workspace activity stream displays the latests events that occurred in the social workspace.
It can be displayed on the social workspace's activity dashboards only.

## User's Activity Stream

The user's activity stream displayed the latest actions done by the user.
It is displayed on the user's profile only.

## User's Network Activity Stream

The user's network activity stream displays information about what your network members do on the application:

*   which workspaces they join,
*   what documents they work on (in social workspaces and in the document management area of the application),
*   who they add to their network.

The network activity stream can be displayed on the user's dashboard and the Collaboration home dashboard, using the **Network Activity Stream** gadget in the **Nuxeo** category. It is also displayed on the Activity Stream tab of the user Home.
