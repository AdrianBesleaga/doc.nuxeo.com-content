Users can like documents, messages and activities.
For message and activities likes, see the [Wall Overview]({{page page='wall-overview'}}) page.

## Voting for a Document

Users need the **Read** right to vote for a document. They can vote for documents from the document's Summary tab or from the Document Library gadget in social workspaces.

**To vote for a document from the Summary tab:**
Click on the&nbsp;icon ![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}}).
Your vote is added to the current document rating. The icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}}).

**To vote for a document from the Document Library gadget:**
Click on the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;displayed below the document in the gadget.

![]({{file name='like-doc-library-gadget.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

Your vote is added to the current document rating. The icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='like.png' page='icons-index'}})&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}}).

![]({{file name='like-doc-library-gadget-liked.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)

## Voting against a Document

It is not possible to vote against a document. Users can only unlike the documents they have voted for, by following the same steps as to vote for a document. Clicking**&nbsp;![]({{file name='unlike.png' page='icons-index'}})**&nbsp;removes their vote from the document's rating.
