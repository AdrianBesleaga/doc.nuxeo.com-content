## Setting up Your Social Workspace Dashboards

Social workspaces come with default public and private dashboards. However, the administrators of the social workspace can customize the workspace's dashboards from the Document Management view, following the same steps as to [customize their personal dashboard]({{page page='dashboard#customizing-your-dashboard'}}).

## Setting up the Collaboration Domain Dashboard

The Collaboration domain also comes with a default dashboard, that the application's administrators can customize from the Collaboration view. They can [change the dashboard layout]({{page page='dashboard#changing-the-dashboard-layout'}}), [add or remove gadgets]({{page page='dashboard#adding-and-removing-widgets'}}), [move them]({{page page='dashboard#organizing-your-widgets'}}) just like they can on the user dashboard.
