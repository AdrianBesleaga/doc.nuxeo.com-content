In order to help you find the documents that you need, the Nuxeo Platform features several options to access documents.

### Browsing Content
#### Side Menu
The side menu offers two different tabs. Clicking on elements on the left will open a side panel with the content of the tab selected: browsing options are on the first left column, content to browse on the second and content to view on the main area.
This new pattern allows to start browsing without changing the context of work.
The side menu displays all the domain structure from the root. It enables you to easily access any space in the application structure.

#### Dashboard

CREATE EXCERPT FROM JSF


Every user has a personal dashboard that displays information he finds relevant and help him have a global view of the application's activity.

The dashboard is composed of a set of boxes that display either a list of documents matching a criteria (all the workspaces the user can access, the last documents he modified, the last documents that have been published...), or possibly a piece of information either from the Platform or from external websites.

To access your dashboard, click on icon on the top left hand corner.

#### Browsing Lists of Documents

Users can change the way content is presented in the folderish repositories (workspaces, folders, sections) and search results.They can also change the displayed information.

##### Changing the View Mode
Two views of the content lists are available on the top right corner of your workspace

- Table View (default view) (ICON): this view displays title of the documents with a small icon (that depends on the type of document or main attachment type) and a set of metadata in a table;

- Grid View (ICON): this view displays a thumbnail of documents. For folders, the thumbnail of the first item in the folder is displayed.

##### Changing Displayed Information
Lists of documents, whether in grid view or thumbnail view, show some information about the documents, like their title, the last contributor, their life cycle state, etc. Users can change the information displayed, i.e. the columns for the list view or the information below the document thumbnail in thumbnail view.

To change the information displayed in content views, click on the icon (ICON). A pop-up is displayed: select the information that you want to be displayed among the list.
