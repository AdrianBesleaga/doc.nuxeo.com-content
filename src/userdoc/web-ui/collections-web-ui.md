{{! excerpt}}

Collections are a folder-like document in which you can classify existing documents. Documents are not actually copied or moved into the collection, which only holds a link to the document in its original location.

{{! /excerpt}}

It enables you to create your own organization of the content without duplicating content and having the size of the content growing uncontrollably.

The list of collections available to you is available from your Home, in the **Collections** tab.

## Collecting Documents

You can classify any type of document in a collection. You just need to have Read access to the document to be able to collect it. Collecting a document doesn't give you more permissions on the document: your permissions are the one defined on the original parent of the document.

Documents can be collected:

- Individually by clicking on the icon ![]({{file name='add-to-collection-web-ui.png' page='icons-index' space='userdoc'}} ?w=16) of the document
  SCREENSHOT POPUP COLLECTION
- By batch by selecting documents from their parent and clicking on the Add to collection button.

In the two cases you can select the collection by:
- Browsing the collections in the list
- Starting to type the collection name and select it
- Typing a new collection name to create it.

The list of collections the document is available from is displayed on its **View** tab

## Creating Collections
Collections can be created in workspaces and folders.

There are two ways to create a collection:
- Like any other document, using the **New** button: Just fill in the creation form and the collection is created in the current workspace / folder.
    SCREENSHOT POPUP
- Directly from the "Add to collection" popup: collections about to be created are displayed with the icon
