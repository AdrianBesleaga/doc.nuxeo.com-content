All the documents evolve according to a defined life cycle. The default life cycle is composed of the following states: Project, Approved, Obsolete and Deleted. There are different ways to make documents evolve through this life cycle. One of the ways is to use a workflow.

Users who are involved in workflows are alerted by email and can have a synthetic view of all their pending tasks on documents in their&nbsp;[dashboard]({{page space='USERDOC' page='Browsing Content#BrowsingContent-Dashboard'}}). The documents they have to review are listed there.

A task represents what a workflow instance expects from a user or a group of users. Usually they are expected to give some information through a form and click on a button (like Accept, Reject, Confirm, Notify, Transform, etc.). A task usually has one or several assignees, a title, a directive and an expected date of achievement. The task assignees can be specified directly in the task definition or can be dynamically computed.
