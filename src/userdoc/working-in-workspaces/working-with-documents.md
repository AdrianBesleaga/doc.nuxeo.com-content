The Nuxeo Platform enables you to create, edit and share documents within the application.

## Available Documents

Documents are sorted in two categories:

*   Collaborative services
*   Documents

**Collaborative services**

Collaborative services are folderish documents that enable users to share information.
The naked Platform collaborative services are:

*   [Workspaces]({{page page='working-with-workspaces'}})
*   [Folders]({{page page='folders'}})
*   [Forum]({{page page='forums'}})
*   [Collections]({{page page='collections'}})

**Documents**

Documents available in the naked Platform are:

*   The [note]({{page page='notes'}}): a text typed in a rich editor integrated to the Nuxeo Platform;
*   The [file]({{page page='files'}}): an attached file.

## Documents Evolution

The evolution of a document, each time contributors edit it, constitutes its life cycle. This life cycle is composed of the following states:

*   **Project**: the document has been created and it can be modified;
*   **Approved**: the document has been approved and is considered as valid. Modifying it makes it back to project life cycle state;
*   **Obsolete**: the document is not accurate anymore and, for instance, has been replaced by a new version;
*   **Deleted**: the document is moved into the workspace or folder trash.

To change the life cycle state of a document, you need to submit it to a [workflow]({{page page='workflows'}}).
