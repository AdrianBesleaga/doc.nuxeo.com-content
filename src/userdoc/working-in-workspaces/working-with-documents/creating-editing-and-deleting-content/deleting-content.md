Only users with "Write" or "manage everything" rights can delete documents from a space.

Deleting a document occurs in two steps:

1.  A user moves a document to trash.
2.  The manager of the space [deletes the document permanently]({{page page='managing-deleted-documents'}}).

{{! excerpt}}

To move a document into the **Trash** tab you need to delete it from the workspace content table.

{{! /excerpt}}

**To delete a document from the Content tab of the workspace:**

1.  In the **Content** tab of the workspace, check the box in front of the document's name.
2.  Click on the **Delete** button.
3.  On the window that pops up, click on the **OK** button.
    The document is moved to the **Trash** tab of the workspace (available to users with management rights only) and does not appear in the workspace's content list.

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Quick deletion'}}

You can also delete documents using right-click on document from the **Content** tab of the workspace.

{{/callout}}

![]({{file name='right-click-menu.png' page='editing-content'}} ?w=350,border=true)
