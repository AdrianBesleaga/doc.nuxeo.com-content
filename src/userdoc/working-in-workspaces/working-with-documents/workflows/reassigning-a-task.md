Since 5.9.1, if you feel that you should not be responsible for a task, you can reassign it. Reassignment should not be confused with [delegation]({{page page='delegating-a-task'}}).

{{! multiexcerpt name='delegate-vs-reassign'}} {{#> callout type='info' heading='Reassignment vs Delegation'}}

&nbsp;When you delegate a task, you remain responsible for the task. You don't lose your rights on the document: you can still process the task if you want to. On the contrary, you lose your rights on the task and on the document when you reassign your task on a document. The user you reassign the task to becomes responsible for the task and it is as if you never had to review the document.

{{/callout}}{{! /multiexcerpt}}

You can reassign a task from:

*   The Process view of the tasks in the Home Workflow tab,
*   The Workflow tab of the document.

To reassign a task from **the Home Workflow tab:**

1.  Click on the&nbsp;**Process**&nbsp;button of the task to delegate.
2.  In the&nbsp;**More**&nbsp;menu in the top right corner, click on **Reassign task**.
    ![]({{file name='workflow-home-more-menu.png' page='delegating-a-task'}} ?w=650,h=172,border=true)
    The Reassignment form is displayed in a pop-up.
    ![]({{file name='reassign-popup.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)
3.  In the Users field, type the name of a user or group.
4.  Click on the user or group you want to reassign the task to.
5.  Optionally repeat these steps as many times as you want to reassign the task.
6.  Optionally type a comment for the assignee(s).
7.  Click on the **Reassign** button.
    You are displayed the&nbsp;**My tasks**&nbsp;tab of the&nbsp;**Workflow**&nbsp;tab. The task is not displayed anymore.

**To reassign a task from the document's Workflow tab:**

1.  Click on the **Reassign task**&nbsp;button displayed in the top left corner of the task.
    ![]({{file name='workflow-doc-tab.png' page='delegating-a-task'}} ?w=450,border=true)
    The reassignment form is displayed in a pop-up.
    ![]({{file name='reassign-popup.png'}} ?w=450,border=true)
2.  In the Users field, type the name of a user or group.
3.  Click on the user or group you want to reassign the task to.
4.  Optionally repeat these steps as many times as you want to reassign the task.
5.  Optionally type a comment for the new assignee(s).
6.  Click on the **Reassign** button.
    The Workflow tab of the document is displayed: you have no task anymore.
