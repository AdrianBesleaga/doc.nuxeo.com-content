You need to have writing or management rights to start a workflow.

To start a workflow, you need to select the workflow type, reviewers and review type.

**To start a workflow:**

1.  On the **Summary** tab, in the **Workflow process** section, select the workflow type you want to start and click on the **Start** button.
    ![]({{file name='summary-tab-no-workflow.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
    The form to select the reviewers and start the workflow is displayed on the **Summary** tab. A **Show graph view** button is also available, that displays the workflow route in a pop-up window.
    ![]({{file name='workflow-choose-reviewers-task-summary.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
    A **Workflow** tab is now available on the document from which you can select the reviewers, [delegate your task]({{page page='delegating-a-task'}}), show the graph view but also see the current and previous tasks and [abandon the workflow]({{page page='abandoning-a-workflow'}}).
    ![]({{file name='workflow-choose-reviewers-task-workflow-tab.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
2.  Add users on the workflow:
    1.  In the **Participants on the review** field, type the name of a user or a group.
        The users and groups corresponding to the letters typed are displayed.
        ![]({{file name='workflow-reviewer-selection.png'}} ?w=350,h=196,border=true)
    2.  Click on the user you want to add on the workflow.
    3.  Repeat these two steps to add all the participants to the review.
    4.  Optionally, drag and drop the participants to change their order on the workflow, or the icon&nbsp;![]({{file name='action-delete.png' page='icons-index'}}) to remove them.{{{multiexcerpt 'tasks-assigned-to-group' page='Participating to a Serial Workflow'}}}
3.  Select the type of review you want to do:
    *   Simple review: the document's state will not change.
    *   Validation review: when all the reviewers have approved the document, it goes to the **Approved** life cycle state.
        ![]({{file name='workflow-review-type-selection.png'}} ?w=350,border=true)
4.  Type a comment, indicating the purpose of the review for instance.
5.  Click on the **Start the review** button to let participants approve or reject the document.
    Only the **Show graph view** button remains on the **Summary** tab. The document remains unlocked.
    On the **Workflow** tab, the current task and the previous ones are displayed.
    ![]({{file name='workflow-choose-participants-done.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
    The first participant(s) on the review get(s) an email and have his (their) task displayed on his (their) dashboard.
