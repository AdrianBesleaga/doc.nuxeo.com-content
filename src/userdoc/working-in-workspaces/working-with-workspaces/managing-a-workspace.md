Users with management rights can parameter the workspace.

All management actions are available in the **Manage** tab of the workspace. This is the place where you can:

*   [Set access rights]({{page page='managing-access-rights'}}) on the workspace to define who can read the content, edit it or delegate management of the workspace,
*   Set [alerts]({{page page='alerts'}}) for other users so they get automatically informed of the content evolution,
*   [Manage deleted documents]({{page page='managing-deleted-documents'}}) in the workspace **Trash**,
*   Change the look of the workspace by [choosing a preset theme]({{page page='applying-a-preset-look-to-a-space'}}),
*   Define the sections in which users will be able to publish from the document (called [publication targets]({{page page='setting-publication-targets'}})).
