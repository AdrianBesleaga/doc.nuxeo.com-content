If customized search forms have been contributed, it is possible to define which one to display from a space. This enables users to have search forms adapted to the documents and processes used in the space.

It is possible to enable several search forms on a space. This allows users to have several forms and possibly predefined searches that they can edit.

**To enable contributed searches:**

1.  Click on the **Manage** tab of the space.
2.  Click on the **Local configuration** sub-tab.
3.  If needed, click on the **Enable** link of the search configuration.
    The default search forms provided in the Nuxeo Platform and the list of contributed searches are displayed.
4.  Move the searches you want to enable from the space to the "Enabled content view" list.
    ![]({{file name='local-search-configuration.png'}} ?w=600,border=true)

5.  Click on the **Save** button.
    Users that have access to the space now have the selected searches available when they click on the Search tab from this space.
    ![]({{file name='local-search-configuration-result.png'}} ?w=300,border=true,thumbnail=true)

{{#> callout type='tip' heading='Disabling a search'}}

To remove a search, move it back to the "Existing content view" list on the left and click **Save**.

{{/callout}}
