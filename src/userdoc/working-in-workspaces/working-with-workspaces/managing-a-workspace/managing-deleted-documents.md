When they are deleted by users with "write" rights, documents are moved into the **Trash** tab of the parent folder (domain, workspace, folder, etc). Users with "manage everything" rights can still restore them or delete them permanently.

## Restoring Documents{{> anchor 'restore-documents'}}

Only users with management rights can restore documents.

When they are deleted by users with writing rights, documents are moved into the **Trash** tab of workspaces or folders. They are not erased from the application and can still be restored, i.e. moved back into the **Content** tab of the workspace.

**To restore a document:**

1.  Go on the **Trash** tab of the workspace.
    ![]({{file name='trash-tab.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
2.  Check the box in front of the document's name.
3.  Click on the **Restore** button.
4.  On the window that pops up, click on the **OK** button.
    The document is moved back into the **Content** tab of the workspace.
    It takes the 'project' life cycle state, even if its life cycle state before deletion was "approved" or "obsolete".

## Permanently Deleting Documents{{> anchor 'permanently-delete-documents'}}

Only users with management rights can manage the trash of a space and delete documents permanently.

**To delete a document permanently:**

1.  In the **Trash** tab of the workspace, check the box in front of the document's name.
    ![]({{file name='trash-tab.png'}} ?w=650,border=true)
2.  Click on the **Permanent delete** button.
3.  On the window that pops up, click on the **OK** button.
    The document is permanently erased from the application. It cannot be restored.
    The [relations]({{page page='relations'}}) to the deleted document are deleted.

**To empty the trash (deleting all documents into trash) permanently:**

![]({{file name='empty-trash.png'}} ?w=500)

1.  Click on the **Empty trash** button. (The button appears when no document has been selected)
2.  On the window that pops up, click on the **OK** button.
    The documents are permanently erased from the application. It cannot be restored.
    The [relations]({{page page='relations'}}) to the deleted documents are deleted.
