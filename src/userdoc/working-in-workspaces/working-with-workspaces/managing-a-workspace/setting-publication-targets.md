In order to guide users when they publish documents and make sure documents are published in the correct sections, you can define publication targets for the workspace's documents. Publishing targets are sections in which the documents from the workspace will be publishable. Users will then be able to publish documents only in the sections you have defined.

By default, workspaces don't have any targets defined.

**To define the publication targets of a workspace:**

1.  Click on the **Manage** tab of the workspace.
    The **Access Rights** tab is displayed by default.
2.  Click on the **Publication targets** tab.
    If no section has been defined yet, users can submit documents to publishing in any section (providing they have the rights to publish).
3.  Unfold the sections tree and click on the **Add** link of the sections to which you want to restrict publishing from this workspace.
    The selected sections are displayed in a table below the tree. No **Add** link is available anymore for these sections.
    ![]({{file name='publicationTargets-added.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
    When they click on the **Publish** tab of documents to publish a document, only the selected sections are available to publish the document.
    ![]({{file name='publish-with-targets.png'}} ?w=500,border=true)
4.  Click on the icon to remove a section from the workspace's targets.
